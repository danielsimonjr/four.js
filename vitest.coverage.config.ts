// Shared coverage gate for the per-package unit suites.
//
// This config is never used by `bun run test`: the per-package `test` scripts
// keep running plain `vitest run --passWithNoTests`, so the normal path pays no
// instrumentation cost. The root `coverage` script runs each `packages/*`
// package against this file via `tools/run-in-packages.mjs` instead — every
// package sits at the same depth, so the relative path
// `../../vitest.coverage.config.ts` is uniform, and Vitest's project root stays
// the package directory the command was executed in.
//
// The `include` glob is therefore package-relative: `src/**/*.ts` is the
// package's own source. `coverage.all` (Vitest's default) keeps files that no
// test ever imports in the denominator, so a package cannot pass by shipping
// untested modules.
//
// Two gates, stacked (measured 2026-09-06 against all 24 packages):
//
// 1. Package aggregate ≥ 95% lines / statements / functions / branches — the
//    existing CI threshold. Do not raise this; a strong file may still lift a
//    package average.
// 2. Per-file floor 80% lines / functions / statements. A 0% file can no longer
//    hide behind that average. Branches are omitted here: `math/src/alloc-counter.ts`
//    is 75% branches on the `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` wrap, and a four-branch
//    file's percentage is too volatile for a per-file branch gate. The package
//    95% still covers branches in aggregate.
//
// Why a reporter, not `thresholds.perFile: true`: Vitest 3.2.7 applies that
// flag to the *same* numbers as the package gate, so enabling it would require
// every file ≥ 95% (or would force the package numbers down). The object form
// (`perFile: { lines: 80 }`) is a later Vitest API. The Istanbul reporter in
// `tools/per-file-coverage-floor.cjs` is the 3.2.7-compatible split.
//
// Weakest intentional file: `physics-rapier/src/init.ts` at 86.95% lines — the
// transcribed Rapier wasm typings / load cache (§37). 80% sits just below that
// with a few points of remapping headroom. No other measured file is below 95%
// lines or functions. Stubs (`physics-box2d`, `physics-soft`, `render-canvas`,
// `render-svg`) stay *included*: each is a one-line `PACKAGE_NAME` export with a
// smoke test at 100%. Type-only modules are empty (0 statements → skipped by
// the reporter, 100% in the table). There is no generated `src/`. Vitest's
// default exclude already drops `**/*.d.ts`.
