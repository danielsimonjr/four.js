/**
 * Playwright configuration for the browser gates (WP-3.8, extended by WP-5.8,
 * WP-6.6, WP-7.7, WP-9.4, the post-plan UI proof and the §93 first-3D-scene
 * proof).
 *
 * The suite drives **ten built example sites** in headless Chromium (six until
 * 2026-08-07, when `first-3d-scene` and then the §118 flagship joined; nine on
 * 2026-08-08, when §119's motor digital twin joined; ten on 2026-08-29, when
 * the §12 character-controller example joined):
 *
 * | site | port | specs | what it gates |
 * | ---- | ---- | ----- | ------------- |
 * | `examples/first-2d-scene` | {@link PORT} | `example`, `smoothness`, `animation`, `interaction` | the page loads clean, the canvas is not blank, it animates smoothly, and the pointer reaches it (§106, §106a) |
 * | `examples/first-3d-scene` | {@link SCENE_3D_PORT} | `first-3d-scene` | §93's first 3D scene: a `PerspectiveCamera` over `LitMaterial` meshes under a `DirectionalLight` plus scene ambient — the first browser evidence for the §47 perspective path, the §68 lighting MVP and the §53 3D primitives |
 * | `examples/physics-playground` | {@link PLAYGROUND_PORT} | `playground`, `sensor-tally` | §108's mixed 2D/3D physics demo: gravity, collisions, impulses and sensors through one API — since 2026-08-29 with §39's step-8/step-9 split (`PhysicsEventSystem` + a `PRIORITY_SENSOR_UPDATE` tally, PH-21's seam occupied) |
 * | `examples/character-controller` | {@link CHARACTER_PORT} | `character-controller` | the §12 controller family: `SweptCharacterController` (§30 capsule sweeps, step-up, wall slide), `FirstPersonLook` on a child eye (§44's yaw ∘ pitch decomposition) and the plane-tier `CharacterController` on patrol, under the §39 input → kinematics → solve ordering |
 * | `examples/mechanism` | {@link MECHANISM_PORT} | `mechanism` | §109's jointed mechanism: a motorised shaft, three hinges, a limited slider, a spring and two limit switches, stable under a real-time load and reconfigurable while running |
 * | `examples/blending` | {@link BLENDING_PORT} | `blending` | §110's physics-animation blending: an animated chain handed to the solver as a ragdoll and blended back onto its animation, without abrupt discontinuities |
 * | `examples/particles-demo` | {@link PARTICLES_PORT} | `particles` | §112's particle demonstration: a seeded CPU fountain under §27 fields bouncing off a collision plane, plus a click burst, each drawn as one instanced draw call |
 * | `examples/ui-demo` | {@link UI_PORT} | `ui` | §73–§75's retained-mode UI: a `@four/ui` panel of buttons and labels laid out by the package, skinned by the application, driven by real pointer and keyboard input (the WP-11.5 packet-intent closure) |
 * | `examples/flagship/one-scene-everything-moves` | {@link FLAGSHIP_PORT} | `one-scene-everything-moves` | §118's flagship: one scene holding 2D art, lit 3D meshes, rigid bodies, two joints, particles, world-space text and a screen-space UI panel, with pause / slow-motion / single-step controls |
 * | `examples/flagship/motor-digital-twin` | {@link TWIN_PORT} | `motor-digital-twin` | §119's engineering flagship: a motorised shaft on two bearing hinges inside a sprung stator, a `PIDController` closing the speed loop, §40 unit readouts, §84 statistics, fault injection, and §34 record/seek/replay with §79 save-and-reload |
 *
 * **In the `chromium` project there are no golden images** — SwiftShader
 * rasterises slightly differently from a GPU, so every assertion in
 * `tests/browser` is a threshold, never a pixel match (§92). This sentence was
 * unqualified ("There are no golden images") until 2026-08-05, which stopped
 * being true when the `visual` project below landed on 2026-08-04: that project
 * runs `tests/visual` and *does* compare committed PNG goldens, legitimately,
 * because both sides of its comparison are SwiftShader. See the comment on the
 * `visual` project for the scope of the exception.
 *
 * Run **all ten** builds first — or just `pnpm examples:build`, which is the
 * one place they are listed: the web servers below serve the *built* `dist`
 * directories, which are gitignored and may be absent.
 *
 * ```sh
 * pnpm example:build          # examples/first-2d-scene/dist
 * pnpm first-3d-scene:build   # examples/first-3d-scene/dist
 * pnpm playground:build       # examples/physics-playground/dist
 * pnpm mechanism:build        # examples/mechanism/dist
 * pnpm blending:build         # examples/blending/dist
 * pnpm particles-demo:build   # examples/particles-demo/dist
 * pnpm ui-demo:build          # examples/ui-demo/dist
 * pnpm flagship:build         # examples/flagship/one-scene-everything-moves/dist
 * pnpm twin:build             # examples/flagship/motor-digital-twin/dist
 * pnpm character:build        # examples/character-controller/dist
 * pnpm test:browser
 * ```
 *
 * `use.baseURL` stays the first site's, so every pre-existing spec keeps
 * navigating with `page.goto("/")` unchanged; `first-3d-scene.spec.ts`,
 * `playground.spec.ts`,
 * `mechanism.spec.ts`, `blending.spec.ts`, `particles.spec.ts` and `ui.spec.ts`
 * name their own absolute URLs, and restate {@link SCENE_3D_PORT} /
 * {@link PLAYGROUND_PORT} /
 * {@link MECHANISM_PORT} / {@link BLENDING_PORT} / {@link PARTICLES_PORT} /
 * {@link UI_PORT} / {@link FLAGSHIP_PORT} / {@link TWIN_PORT} for the reason the other specs restate the example's
 * scene constants — a browser gate checks the built page from the outside, and
 * a spec that imported this file would drag a second copy of the config into
 * every worker.
