/**
 * §78 — loading a glTF model, end to end.
 *
 * Added 2026-09-07 because §78 shipped **tested but undemonstrated**: a browser
 * gate and unit tests covered the loader, and no example loaded a model. "Load
 * my model" is the first thing anyone tries with a 3D engine, so the absence
 * was an adoption gap rather than a correctness one.
 *
 * It exists to show the two things a first attempt gets wrong:
 *
 * 1. **The entry point is `createGltfLoader`, not a `loadGltf`.** The loader is
 *    built once and handed to `AssetManager.load`, which owns the cache, the
 *    refcount and the single fetch per URL (§76).
 * 2. **A `.gltf` with an external buffer just works now.** The loader defaults
 *    its transport to `globalThis.fetch`, the same default `AssetManager` makes,
 *    so `createGltfLoader()` fetches the `.bin` beside the document. It did not
 *    until 2026-09-07: this example was written because that first attempt
 *    failed, and the fix came out of writing it. A runtime with no global fetch
 *    still refuses loudly and names `{ fetch }` as the way in.
 *
 * The model is the same `quad.gltf` fixture the browser gate uses: one mesh, one
 * material, one external buffer, no images — the smallest file that still
 * exercises the buffer path that trips people up.
