/**
 * four.js — the blending example, and the §110 demonstration.
 *
 * §110 asks that
 *
 * > a character or machine can move between animated, kinematic, and physical
 * > control without abrupt discontinuities.
 *
 * This page is one articulated chain that does exactly that, on a click:
 *
 * | mode           | who owns the pose                                                                                       |
 * | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | **ANIMATED**   | a looping clip drives each link's `PoseTarget`; the links are `"kinematic-position"`, animation weight 1 |
 * | **RAGDOLL**    | `setBodyControlMode("dynamic", { inheritVelocityFrom })` hands the chain to Rapier, physics weight 1      |
 * | **RECOVERING** | the two §19 weights sweep back over 1.5 s, then the links are re-typed kinematic and the wave resumes     |
 *
 * Every pose you see is the **output of §19's blend**: `lerp`/`slerp` between the
 * pose the animation asked for and the pose the solver produced, weighted by the
 * `RigidBody`'s `animationWeight` / `physicsWeight` and written by the world
 * under the `"blended"` transform authority (§42). Nothing in this file ever
 * writes a link's transform.
 *
 * ## The §19 pipeline, and the one system an application must register
 *
 * Three systems run per fixed step, in §39 priority order regardless of the
 * order they are registered in:
 *
 * ```text
 * 299  createPoseTargetCaptureSystem(physics.worlds)   §19 history: previous ← current
 * 300  AnimationSystem                                 the mixers write PoseTargets
 * 600  PhysicsSystem                                   feed targets → solve → publish blend
 * ```
 *
 * The capture system is **not** registered by `Application`, and it is not
 * optional here: `setBodyControlMode`'s velocity inheritance finite-differences
 * `PoseTarget.position` against `PoseTarget.previousPosition` over one fixed
 * step, and without the capture that history never moves — the switch would
 * divide the target's *total* animated displacement by one fixed delta and
 * inherit an absurd velocity (measured at 60 m/s from a 2 m/s animation,
 * WP-7.5). One line, and the ragdoll activation is honest.
 *
 * ## What the click actually does, step by step
 *
 * ```text
 * ANIMATED ──click──▶ RAGDOLL ──click──▶ RECOVERING ──1.5 s──▶ ANIMATED  (+1 cycle)
 *
 * ANIMATED    type kinematic-position   weights 0 / 1   the solver is fed the target
 * RAGDOLL     type dynamic              weights 1 / 0   the solver owns the chain
 * RECOVERING  type dynamic              weights 1−w / w   w = i/90, one notch per step
 *             …then type kinematic-position, weights 0 / 1
 * ```
 *
 * Two details are load-bearing, and both are WP-7.5's:
 *
 * - **Both** weights are written during the sweep (`1 − w` and `w`), not just
 *   the animation one: `normalizedWeights` divides by their sum, so leaving
 *   `physicsWeight` at 1 would ramp the published animation share as
 *   `w / (1 + w)` — only ½ at `w = 1`. Writing both makes the published share
 *   exactly `w`, and the per-step weight change exactly `1/90`.
 * - The re-type to `"kinematic-position"` happens **after** a step that already
 *   published at full animation weight. At that point the node has been
 *   following the target alone for a step, so re-typing teleports the *solver
 *   body* onto the target and cannot move the node at all. That ordering is the
 *   whole reason the sweep comes first, and it is what makes the second switch
 *   continuous rather than a scripted snap.
 *
 * ## Where this deviates from WP-7.5's integration rig (and what it costs)
 *
 * The integration suite re-seeds each `PoseTarget` from the pose the ragdoll
 * landed in before sweeping, so the crossfade is short by construction. This
 * page deliberately does **not**: the wave keeps playing all the way through the
 * ragdoll (at animation weight 0 it is invisible, but it is running), so the
 * chain blends from where it fell back onto a wave that never stopped — the
 * get-up is a genuine metres-wide crossfade, and you can watch it happen against
 * the target ghosts. The cost is a larger per-step displacement during the
 * sweep, bounded by `gap / 90 + the wave's own speed`; it is measured, and it is
 * the largest number the page reports (`data-step`).
 *
 * ## The wave is a real clip, sampled from forward kinematics
 *
 * Each link's target is driven by an `AnimationMixer` playing a looping
 * `AnimationClip` with a `position` and a `rotation` track — the ordinary §16/§17
 * path, aimed at a `PoseTarget` instead of a transform (which is the only thing
 * §19 changes about animating something). The keys are sampled from the closed
 * form
 *
 * ```text
 * aᵢ(t) = BASE_ANGLE + AMPLITUDE · sin(ωt − i · PHASE_LAG)      ω = 2π / PERIOD
 * p₀ = anchor,  pᵢ₊₁ = pᵢ + 2·halfLength·(sin aᵢ, −cos aᵢ)
 * ```
 *
 * — i.e. the chain's own forward kinematics, so **every hinge is exactly
 * satisfied at every key**. A link's node origin is its *proximal joint*, not its
 * centre (the collider is pushed one half-length down by its §24 offset), which
 * is what makes that true: rotating a link about its own origin is a pure
 * rotation, and WP-7.5's door showed what the alternative costs — a centre-origin
 * rig animated along a chord violates its own hinge by millimetres, and a
 * solver-corrected millimetre is exactly the kind of jump §110 is asking about.
 *
 * The one place the rig is not exact is *between* keys: a `position` track
 * interpolates linearly along the chord while the `rotation` track slerps, so a
 * mid-key pose sits inside the arc by `r · Δa² / 8`. At 48 keys per 3.6 s period
 * and this amplitude that is under 0.3 mm, which is why the key count is 48 and
 * not 8.
 *
 * ## Colour discipline (§66: no blending in this tier, so hue is the channel)
 *
 * The playground's and the mechanism's rule, restated for a scene that has to
 * show *two* poses of the same body at once:
 *
 * 1. everything static or scenery is dark and near-neutral — max channel < 0.2,
 *    and no channel differs from another by more than 0.04;
 * 2. every link is bright — max channel > 0.94 — and any two links differ by at
 *    least 0.35 in some channel;
 * 3. a link's **target ghost** is that link's own colour at
 *    {@link GHOST_BRIGHTNESS} — same hue, so it is obvious *whose* target it is;
 *    0.6, so it differs from its own link by at least 0.35 in some channel, and
 *    from every scenery colour by at least 0.35 in some channel too. The ghosts
 *    are the one moving thing that is not bright, and a classifier separates the
 *    two tiers by max channel alone (bodies > 0.94, ghosts < 0.6);
 * 4. the three mode colours the plate switches between differ pairwise by at
 *    least 0.5 in **two** channels, so "the mode changed" survives any
 *    reasonable threshold — and each of them differs from every link and ghost
 *    colour by at least 0.35 in some channel, because the plate and the chain
 *    share a frame.
 *
 * The background is the one deliberate exception to rule 1's separability: it is
 * darker than the scenery (13,15,23 against 48,48,48 and 31,31,33 as framebuffer
 * bytes) but not by 0.35, and nothing measured needs to tell the backdrop from
 * the floor.
 *
 * ## Known approximations and honest limitations
 *
 * - **Velocity inheritance is redundant on this solver, and is passed anyway.**
 *   WP-7.5 measured it: a Rapier `"kinematic-position"` body that is being driven
 *   to per-step targets already carries the velocity Rapier derived from those
 *   targets, and `setBodyType` keeps it, so `inheritVelocityFrom` and no flag at
 *   all travel the same distance to within 2e-6 m. §19's finite difference and
 *   Rapier's own derivation agree; the flag is passed because it is the API's
 *   documented way to say "keep the motion the animation had", and because
 *   another solver — or a target driven by something other than a kinematic
 *   body — would need it.
 * - **The anchor block carries no collider.** It is a `"static"` body because a
 *   joint's fixed side is a body, not a point (§28); nothing should ever contact
 *   it, and giving it contact geometry would let the falling chain slap into it.
 * - **The ghosts are drawn, not simulated.** They are plain scene nodes with no
 *   components, whose transform this file copies from each `PoseTarget` once per
 *   frame. They are narrower than the links and drawn behind them, so while the
 *   chain is animated they are exactly hidden — the ghosts appear precisely when
 *   the pose and the target diverge, which is the only time they mean anything.
 * - **No transparency.** This renderer tier enables `GL_BLEND` for sprites only
 *   (finding, WP-4.7), so overlap is resolved by depth alone: bodies sit at
 *   z = 0 as §21 requires, ghosts and scenery are pushed behind them, and the
 *   plate's mark in front of the plate.
 * - **Sleeping is left on** (§32, unlike `examples/mechanism`). A settled ragdoll
 *   that Rapier puts to sleep is a feature here — it stops jittering on the floor
 *   — and every transition out of that state goes through `setBodyControlMode`,
 *   which wakes the body by default.
