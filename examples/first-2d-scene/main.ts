/**
 * four.js — first 2D scene, the interaction demo of §106a, and the authored
 * animation of §107.
 *
 * The smallest program that shows three of the four pillars cooperating over
 * one scene graph:
 *
 * - **Scene** — every object below is a node in a single graph: the camera, the
 *   ground, the circle, the box, the diamond, the vane, and the letters of the
 *   label. There is no separate "2D layer": the circle is a flat XY shape and
 *   the box is a solid, and they share the same right-handed, Y-up world (§7a).
 * - **Render** — one `WebglRenderer` draws that graph through one viewport
 *   (§48, §62). Nothing in the scene names WebGL; swapping the backend is a
 *   one-line change at this file's top.
 * - **Motion** — three different ways of moving something, side by side. The
 *   circle follows a prescribed path (`KinematicController` + a §13
 *   trajectory); the box integrates an angular velocity (`MotionComponent`);
 *   the diamond and the vane are driven by *authored curves* — tweens, a clip,
 *   and a timeline (§15–§17). All three are components or players advanced by
 *   systems registered on the application (§39), and the §39 order runs
 *   animation (priority 300) before kinematics (400), which is what §19's
 *   blending pipeline will need in Phase 5.
 *
 * The fourth pillar, **Physics**, arrives in Phase 5 — and will attach to these
 * same nodes as one more component, under one more transform authority (§42).
 *
 * ## What you can do to it (§71, §72, §55, §56)
 *
 * - **Click** the circle or the box: each cycles its material colour through a
 *   small palette. The click is picked with a camera ray against the node's own
 *   bounds and delivered as a scene event that propagates through the graph.
 * - **Drag** the box: the pointer's motion is converted to a world-space
 *   displacement and applied to the node's position — under an authority
 *   handover the drag performs explicitly (see "Dragging and §42" below).
 * - The **label** above the scene is real geometry, not DOM: a bitmap glyph
 *   atlas, laid out into quads, drawn as **one** textured `Text` node in the
 *   same graph as everything else.
 * - The **diamond** on the right and the **vane** on the left are not
 *   interactive at all: they are running authored animation, and the section
 *   below says exactly which kind.
 *
 * ## The authored cluster (§15, §16, §17 — the §107 exit criterion)
 *
 * Phase 4's exit asks for every §17 track value type to reach the screen. Two
 * small shapes, deliberately off to the sides, carry one each:
 *
 * | kind           | what animates                        | who drives it       |
 * | -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
 * | **vector**     | the diamond's `transform.position`   | a yoyo `Tween`      |
 * | **quaternion** | the vane's `transform.rotation`      | an `AnimationMixer` over a clip |
 * | **color**      | the diamond's material RGBA          | a `Tween` on the `Timeline` |
 * | **numeric**    | the vane's `transform.scale` x and y | a `Tween` on the `Timeline` |
 *
 * and one `Timeline` sequences the last two, with a marker (§16) at its "beat"
 * label that steps the vane's colour through a palette. The vector tween moves
 * a whole `Vector3` rather than two numbers — `to({ "transform.position": … })`,
 * not `to({ x, y })` — so the value really is the §17 *vector* kind and not two
 * scalar tracks wearing a costume. The quaternion track interpolates with
 * `slerp` (three keys 120° apart, so every span takes the short way round).
 *
 * Both shapes declare `transformAuthority = "animation"` (§42) and neither is
 * pickable or draggable: an animation owns their transforms outright, and a
 * click-to-recolour would fight the colour tween's §16 property claim rather
 * than demonstrate anything. The box and the circle are correspondingly *not*
 * animated — they stay under `"kinematic"`, and the drag's authority handover
 * below is unaffected.
 *
 * ## Fixed-step simulation, variable-rate rendering (§10, §43)
 *
 * The loop at the bottom feeds real elapsed seconds to `app.step(...)`. Inside,
 * simulation advances in fixed 1/60 s steps regardless of how fast the display
 * refreshes, and the frame is drawn from *interpolated* poses — which is why
 * `app.poses.track(...)` is called for every moving node. On a 144 Hz screen
 * that is what keeps the motion smooth instead of showing each simulation step
 * two or three times.
 *
 * ## Dragging and §42, in full
 *
 * §42 gives exactly one system authority over a node's transform. The box is
 * normally `"kinematic"`: the `MotionSystem` integrates its angular velocity and
 * owns its transform. A drag wants to write that same transform from the
 * application, which is `"manual"` authority — so the drag *hands ownership
 * over* rather than writing behind the owner's back:
 *
 * ```text
 * dragStart:  motionSystem.untrack(box);  box.transformAuthority = "manual"
 * drag:       box.transform.position.set(… + worldDelta …) ← application writes
 * dragEnd:    box.transformAuthority = "kinematic";  motionSystem.track(box)
 * ```
 *
 * So the box stops tumbling while it is dragged and resumes when it is dropped,
 * and at no instant do two systems claim it. Setting the authority alone would
 * be enough for §42's *enforcement* — `MotionSystem` would refuse the write and
 * warn once (`warnAuthorityConflict`) — but leaving it tracked would mean asking
 * a system every step to do something it is not allowed to do. Untracking says
 * the same thing without the warning, which is what a handover actually is
 * (decision, WP-3a.5).
 *
 * ## What the label costs (§49, §56 — and what it used to cost)
 *
 * One `Text` node: **one geometry, one texture, one draw call**, whatever the
 * string says. §53's per-vertex `uvs` address a different atlas cell for every
 * glyph out of a single buffer, which is the thing that makes a label a
 * rectangle-list rather than a pile of nodes.
 *
 * It is worth recording what stood here until 2026-08-21, because the paragraph
 * was the evidence for a backlog item and the item is now closed. `Sprite`
 * derives its texture coordinates affinely from its own quad — the whole texture
 * across the whole sprite — so there was no way to point one at a *cell* of an
 * atlas, and this file cut every distinct cell out into its own 6 × 12 texel
 * `Texture` and drew one `Sprite` per glyph: ~20 textures and 36 draw calls for
 * a 37-character label. R-28's `Text` node (2026-08-13) replaced all of it with
 * three lines, and the count this page now reports is **1**.
