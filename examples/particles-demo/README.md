# Particles

The §112 / §36 demonstration: a seeded CPU particle fountain under §27 force fields, bouncing
off a collision plane, drawn as **one instanced draw call** — plus a second system that fires
a burst when you click.

§112 asks for _"≥100,000 simple particles simulated and rendered at interactive rates on
suitable hardware"_. This page is deliberately **not** that number. Plan §6h splits the
criterion into the parts that can each be shown honestly, and this page is the visible one:

| half of §112                                          | where it is shown                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 100 000 particles simulated on the CPU                | `benchmarks/particles-100k.mjs` — recorded ms/step, never CI-gated      |
| rendered as one batched draw per system               | `@four/render`'s `particles.ts` + `@four/render-webgl`'s instanced path |
| at interactive rates, on screen, responding to a user | **this page**, at ~1 800 particles — the size SwiftShader can sustain   |
| deterministically (plan P9-4)                         | `tests/determinism/phase9-particles.test.ts`                            |

A browser gate with no GPU cannot answer "100 000 particles at 60 fps"; it can answer "the
batched path reaches a real framebuffer, keeps moving, obeys its collision plane, and reacts
to a click", and that is what `tests/browser/particles.spec.ts` measures here.

## Non-wasm, on purpose

There is no physics package on this page and therefore no WebAssembly image. It is the
`first-2d-scene` tier, not the `physics-playground` tier, which is the whole reason a **fifth**
Playwright web server was worth adding (plan §6h weighed it against a gated region in the
playground).

## Running it

```sh
pnpm run build                  # the packages the example imports as `four/…`
pnpm run particles-demo:build   # bundles to examples/particles-demo/dist
npx vite preview examples/particles-demo
```

or, for a dev server with hot reload:

```sh
npx vite examples/particles-demo
```

## The two systems

| node       | emitter                                                       | what it demonstrates                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `fountain` | 900 particles/s, warm ramp, three §27 fields, collision plane | steady-state simulation, force fields, §36 collision  |
| `burst`    | rate 0, cool ramp, gravity only, fired by a click             | §36 bursts, lifetimes expiring, a second batched draw |

Two nodes rather than one, because that is what makes "one draw call **per system**" visible:
the render list carries exactly two particle items and the backend issues exactly two
`drawArraysInstanced`, whatever the particle counts are.

| `collisionPlaneY` / `restitution` | `−2.4` / 0.35                                                                                                                   |

Steady state is `emissionRate × mean lifetime = 900 × 2 = 1800` live particles, and the pool
has 800 slots of headroom above that, so **no spawn is ever dropped** — the page publishes the
drop count so that is checkable rather than assumed.

The field order is part of the contract: floating-point addition is not associative, so
reordering those three lines changes the simulation.

`minDistance: 0.6` on the vortex is not decoration. A vortex's acceleration goes as
`strength / d`, so the default 0.01 floor would cap it at 220 units/s² and fling the particles
that spawn nearest the axis; 0.6 puts the cap at 3.7 units/s², which is a swirl.

### The burst

| option         | value                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `maxParticles` | 1 900 (two overlapping bursts fit)                     |
| `seed`         | 90 402                                                 |
| `position`     | `(0, 0.8, 0)`                                          |
| `emissionRate` | 0 — silent until `emit()`                              |
| per click      | 900 particles                                          |
| `lifetime`     | 1.6 … 2.4 s                                            |
| `initialSpeed` | 1.6 … 3.2 units/s                                      |
| `spreadAngle`  | `π` — a full sphere                                    |
| `size`         | 0.09 → 0.025                                           |
| `color`        | `(0.4, 0.86, 1, 1)` → `(0.16, 0.36, 1, 0)`             |
| `gravity`      | `(0, −3, 0)` — through the emitter option, not a field |

Two of those are chosen against the **instrument**, and they are worth stating because they
would otherwise look arbitrary:

- **Gravity is −3, not −9.81.** At −9.81 a 2-second burst falls 20 world units and leaves a
  6-unit-tall view within half a second.
- **The lifetime is 1.6–2.4 s.** One `canvas.screenshot()` costs about **284 ms** under
  SwiftShader at this size (measured, WP-9.4). A half-second burst would be a race between
  the effect and the camera rather than a test of the effect.

Gravity comes from the emitter's `gravity` option rather than a `uniformGravityField` because
there is exactly one constant acceleration here and the option costs no virtual call per
particle — a difference the benchmark measures at roughly 5 ms per field per 100 000
particles.

## The click, and what it deliberately does not do

A click fires the burst from a **fixed** world position, not from the pointer. That is an MVP
limitation stated rather than worked around: `ParticleEmitterOptions.position` is read once,
in the constructor (WP-9.1 stages runtime re-authoring — §36 gives no invalidation rules for
the derived cone basis or the burst schedule). Moving the _node_ to the pointer would work,
and would also drag every still-live burst particle with it, because particles simulate in the
node's local space; a rapid second click would teleport the first burst. Pointer picking has
its own demonstration in `examples/first-2d-scene` (§71/§72); this page demonstrates §36's
burst.

## Layout, in world units

One orthographic camera shows 8 × 6 world units over an 800 × 600 canvas: **100 CSS pixels per
world unit**, `px = (x + 4) × 100` and `py = (3 − y) × 100`. +Y is up, angles are radians,
times are seconds (§7a). The camera sits at `z = 10` with `near 0.1 / far 20` — a deep
orthographic frustum costs nothing and keeps the spherical burst's ±Z travel inside the view.

| element         | world                        | pixel            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| view bounds     | `x ∈ [−4, 4]`, `y ∈ [−3, 3]` | `0…800`, `0…600` |
| fountain mouth  | `(0, −2.35)`                 | `400, 535`       |
| collision plane | `y = −2.4`                   | row `540`        |
| vortex centre   | `(0, −0.4)`                  | `400, 340`       |
| burst origin    | `(0, 0.8)`                   | `400, 220`       |

## Colour discipline

The browser gate has to attribute a pixel to one system or the other from the outside, and §66
gives this tier no material state to label them with. So hue is the channel:

1. the **fountain** is warm — red leads blue by a wide margin at every point of its ramp;
2. the **burst** is cool — blue leads red by the same margin at every point of its ramp;
3. the **background** is `#0d0f14`, framebuffer bytes `13, 15, 20` (measured under
   SwiftShader at DPR 1) — dark, and with blue _ahead_ of red by 7, so no unlit pixel can be
   warm however a particle fades into it.

Both ramps end at alpha 0, so a particle fades rather than pops, and a half-faded particle
blends toward the background — which moves it _away_ from both classifiers rather than across
them. The gate's classifiers are `red ≥ 90 && red − blue ≥ 45` (fountain) and
`blue ≥ 90 && blue − red ≥ 45` (burst); they cannot both fire on one pixel.

## What the page mirrors onto the DOM

`#status` carries the live simulation as data attributes, so a test can read the engine's own
numbers instead of inferring everything from pixels:

| attribute       | value                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `data-state`    | `loading` → `running`, or `error`               |
| `data-fountain` | live particles in the fountain pool             |
| `data-burst`    | live particles in the burst pool                |
| `data-bursts`   | clicks handled since load                       |
| `data-frames`   | host frames rendered                            |
| `data-dropped`  | spawns refused by either pool — should stay `0` |

They are written from the `update` event — once per host frame, after every fixed step of that
frame has run — because these are counts a _frame_ observes, not quantities a fixed step
produces.

## Bundle size

Well inside the §86 payload budget (150 kB gzip for the built example), and the point of the
page being cheap enough to justify its own preview server: **59 908 B raw / 18 903 B gzip**
for the one JS chunk, plus 2 261 B (1 122 B gzip) of HTML — `gzip -9`, the measurement
`examples/mechanism` and `examples/blending` record. (Vite's own build log reports 59.91 kB /
19.35 kB for the same chunk; it gzips at a lower level.)

For scale: `examples/blending` is 674 667 B gzip, because it embeds a Rapier wasm image. This
page has none.
