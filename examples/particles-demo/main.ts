/**
 * four.js — the §36 particle demonstration (Phase 9, §112; plan §6h, WP-9.4).
 *
 * The smallest program that shows a particle system doing all four things §36
 * asks of the MVP tier, and shows them *in a browser*, on a real WebGL 2
 * surface:
 *
 * - **Simulated on the CPU, per fixed step.** A `ParticleSystem` is registered
 *   on the application's §39 registry at priority 500 and steps the emitters
 *   with the injected `fixedDeltaTime`. Nothing here reads a clock (§33); the
 *   one `performance.now()`-shaped value in this file is the rAF timestamp
 *   handed to `app.step`, which is presentation-side by construction (§10).
 * - **Driven by §27 force fields.** The fountain runs under uniform gravity, a
 *   linear drag and a vortex about +Z, evaluated in that order (the order is
 *   part of the contract — floating-point addition is not associative).
 * - **Collided, at §36's MVP tier.** The fountain has a `collisionPlaneY` with
 *   restitution, so its particles bounce off a floor rather than falling out of
 *   the world.
 * - **Drawn batched.** Each `ParticleRenderable` becomes exactly **one**
 *   `RenderItem`, and `@four/render-webgl` turns that into exactly one
 *   `drawArraysInstanced` — the property §112's 100 000-particle target rests
 *   on. This page is deliberately ~2 000 particles, not 100 000: the browser
 *   gate runs under SwiftShader (software GL) with no GPU, and plan §6h asks for
 *   *a size SwiftShader can sustain* here, with the 100 000 number measured
 *   headlessly in `benchmarks/particles-100k.mjs` instead.
 *
 * ## Non-wasm, on purpose
 *
 * There is no physics package on this page and therefore no WebAssembly image:
 * plan §6h notes that a fifth Playwright web server is only cheap if the site it
 * serves is cheap, and this one is the `first-2d-scene` tier (a few tens of kB
 * gzip) rather than the `physics-playground` tier (~670 kB, two Rapier images).
 * §36 particles need `scene`, `math`, `particles` and a renderer, and nothing
 * else.
 *
 * ## The two systems, and why the second one exists
 *
 * | node       | emitter                                         | what it demonstrates                        |
 * | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
 * | `fountain` | continuous rate, warm ramp, 3 fields, plane      | steady-state simulation and §27 fields      |
 * | `burst`    | rate 0, cool ramp, gravity only, fired on click | §36 bursts, and a second batched draw call  |
 *
 * They are two nodes rather than one because that is what makes "one draw call
 * *per system*" visible: the render list carries exactly two particle items, and
 * the backend issues exactly two instanced draws, whatever the particle counts
 * are.
 *
 * ## Colour discipline
 *
 * The browser gate (`tests/browser/particles.spec.ts`) has to attribute a pixel
 * to one system or the other from the outside, and §66 gives this tier no
 * material state to label them with. So hue is the channel:
 *
 * - the **fountain** is warm — red leads blue by a wide margin at every point of
 *   its ramp;
 * - the **burst** is cool — blue leads red by a wide margin at every point of
 *   its ramp;
 * - the **background** (`#0d0f14`, bytes `13, 15, 23`) is dark and nearly
 *   neutral, so neither classifier can fire on it however a particle's alpha
 *   fades into it.
 *
 * Both ramps end at alpha 0, so a particle fades out rather than popping; a
 * half-faded particle blends toward the background, which moves it *away* from
 * both classifiers rather than across them.
 *
 * ## The click, and what it deliberately does not do
 *
 * A click fires a burst from a **fixed** world position, not from the pointer.
 * That is a limitation of the MVP tier stated rather than worked around:
 * `ParticleEmitterOptions.position` is read once, in the constructor (WP-9.1
 * stages runtime re-authoring, because §36 gives no invalidation rules for the
 * derived cone basis and the burst schedule). The alternative — moving the
 * *node* to the pointer — would work, and would also drag every still-live
 * burst particle with it, because particles simulate in the node's local space
 * (that is the documented semantics, and it is what makes a moving emitter carry
 * its particles). A rapid second click would then teleport the first burst. A
 * fixed origin has no such artefact, and the interaction being demonstrated is
 * §36's burst, not pointer picking — §71/§72 picking already has its own
 * demonstration in `examples/first-2d-scene`.
 *
 * ## Layout, in world units
 *
 * One orthographic camera shows 8 × 6 world units over an 800 × 600 canvas:
 * **100 CSS pixels per world unit**, `px = (x + 4) × 100` and
 * `py = (3 − y) × 100`. +Y is up, angles are radians, times are seconds (§7a).
 * The README tabulates every landmark in both spaces.
