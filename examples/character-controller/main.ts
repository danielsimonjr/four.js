/**
 * four.js — the §12 character-controller example: a first-person walk through
 * a small arena, exercising the whole §12 controller family at once.
 *
 * `PH-11` (2026-08-21) shipped `CharacterController` + `FirstPersonLook` in
 * `@four/motion` and `PH-11b` shipped `SweptCharacterController` +
 * `SweptCharacterSystem` in `@four/physics`, and until this page the only
 * first-person camera and the only swept capsule in the repository lived in
 * tests. This example is the recorded follow-up: one page that exercises all
 * three components and the §39 ordering they depend on.
 *
 * ## What you steer (§12, §30, §42, §44)
 *
 * | thing | component | what it shows |
 * | ----- | --------- | ------------- |
 * | **you** | `SweptCharacterController` (`@four/physics`) | a capsule swept through `PhysicsWorld.shapeCast` (§30): walls stop you by *sliding* you along them, three stair risers are climbed by the step-up (each under its `stepHeight`), jumping and landing are casts, not a plane |
 * | **your eye** | `FirstPersonLook` on a **child** node | §44's first-person decomposition: the character owns yaw (its heading), the eye adds pitch and nothing else, and the camera's world orientation is `yaw ∘ pitch` by ordinary parent-child composition — two nodes, one §42 writer each |
 * | **the patroller** | `CharacterController` (`@four/motion`) | the plane-tier kinematic controller, walking a circle with **no physics body and no world**: its ground is `groundHeight`, its driver is two lines of intent per step, and it needs nothing from the solver |
 * | **the balls** | `RigidBody` (`"dynamic"`) | ordinary §22 dynamics in the same world your capsule sweeps through — they fall, bounce and settle, and your kinematic-position body is real geometry to them |
 *
 * ## Controls
 *
 * WASD moves (intent clamped to the unit disc, so diagonals are not faster);
 * ←/→ turn the character (yaw); ↑/↓ pitch the eye; **drag** the canvas for
 * mouse-look; Space jumps. The arrows apply a fixed radians-per-second rate
 * inside the fixed step, the drag applies the deltas the pointer produced —
 * both are legal because `turn`/`look` take deltas the application chose
 * (the recorded no-rate-limit decision in `character-controller.ts`).
 *
 * ## The §39 ordering, spelled out
 *
 * Four registered systems, in priority order, all inside one fixed step:
 *
 * ```text
 * 100  ControlSystem          keys → intent, turn, look        (§39 step 1)
 * 200  PatrolSystem           the NPC's scripted intent        (§39 step 2)
 * 400  KinematicSystem        advances the NPC and the eye     (§39 step 4)
 * 400  SweptCharacterSystem   sweeps and writes the player     (§39 step 4)
 * 600  PhysicsSystem          steps the Rapier world           (§39 step 6)
 * ```
 *
 * The two step-4 systems share a priority on purpose: they dispatch on
 * disjoint component types, which is the arrangement `PH-11b` recorded
 * (`swept-character-controller.ts`, "One authority, and the second system this
 * could not avoid"). The player writes **before** the solve because its
 * `"kinematic-position"` `RigidBody` is fed from the node transform at the top
 * of `world.step` — write after 600 and the capsule the balls collide with
 * would trail the pose you see by one full step.
 *
 * ## What the browser gate reads
 *
 * The page mirrors the engine's own account of the character onto `#status`
 * (`data-px/py/pz`, `data-grounded`, `data-yaw`, `data-pitch`,
 * `data-stepups`, `data-npcx/npcz`), the pattern every example gate here uses:
 * the attribute says what the simulation believes, the pixels say what reached
 * the screen, and `tests/browser/character-controller.spec.ts` asserts both.
 *
 * ## Numbers that must agree
 *
 * The stair risers are **0.24** and the controller's `stepHeight` is **0.32**:
 * every riser is climbable without jumping, and the browser gate asserts the
 * platform height (`0.72` = three risers) is reached with ≥ 3 accepted
 * step-ups. The capsule is §24's parameterization — total height
 * `2 · (halfHeight + radius)` = 1.7 m — and the collider registered for the
 * player is built from the same two numbers as the controller, so the shape
 * the balls hit and the shape the sweeps cast are the same shape.
