/**
 * four.js — **"One Scene, Everything Moves"**, the §118 flagship demonstration.
 *
 * §118 is not a feature list, it is a claim: that four.js is *one
 * motion-capable engine, not a graphics library with physics bolted on
 * afterward*. The way to prove that claim is to put everything the engine
 * pretends to be into **one scene graph, one fixed-step loop, and one frame** —
 * so this page has exactly one `Application`, one `Scene`, one camera, one
 * `PhysicsWorld`, and one `requestAnimationFrame` loop, and everything below
 * lives inside them.
 *
 * ## §118's list, and where each item is
 *
 * | §118 asks for              | where it is here                                                                                                   |
 * | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
 * | a rotating 3D cube         | {@link CUBE_POSITION}: a `boxGeometry` under a **textured** `LitMaterial`, spun by a §38 `MotionComponent`            |
 * | a 2D vector orbit          | {@link ORBIT_POSITION}: flat `circleGeometry2D`/`planeGeometry` art — a dotted path, a radius **vector**, an orbiter — carried round by a second `MotionComponent` |
 * | a spring-connected pendulum| {@link PENDULUM_ANCHOR}: a §28 `SpringJoint` from a static anchor to a dynamic bob, swinging *and* bouncing on its spring |
 * | a bouncing rigid body      | {@link BALL_START}: a restitution-0.92 sphere the solver drops onto the slab, re-launched by an impulse on each landing |
 * | a world-space label        | two: the scene title above the horizon, and a live `bounces: N` readout that **rides the bouncing body**              |
 * | a screen-space control panel| a `@four/ui` panel parented to the **camera**, so it is fixed in the viewport: three `Button`s and a `Slider`         |
 * | a timeline                 | a §16 `Timeline` sequencing two tweens on different nodes plus a lap marker, looping forever                          |
 * | a motorized hinge          | {@link ROTOR_POSITION}: a `HingeJoint` with an enabled §28 motor turning a rotor bar against gravity                  |
 * | collision events           | the ball's `collisionstart` (§29) drives the bounce counter, the label, a particle burst, and the impulse that keeps it alive |
 * | pause, slow motion, single-step | the three buttons and the slider: `app.pause()`, `scheduler.timeScale`, and one exact fixed step while paused    |
 *
 * Two things §118 does not ask for are here because they are what the scene is
 * *made of*: §36 **particles** (embers at the impact point and a burst per
 * collision) and §84/§113's **debug overlay** (velocity vectors and contact
 * points), which the third button switches on.
 *
 * ## What "one scene" means mechanically
 *
 * Every node below lives in the one scene graph — the control panel included,
 * since it hangs off the camera, which is itself a node in that graph — and
 * each is moved by a *different* system on the same clock. The §39 registry
 * runs them by priority, whatever order they were registered in:
 *
 * ```text
 *   app.step(elapsed)                                   §10 fixed-step accumulator
 *     ├─ fixedUpdate ×N   AnimationSystem  (300)        the timeline and its tweens
 *     │                   MotionSystem     (400)        cube spin, orbit spin
 *     │                   ParticleSystem   (500)        embers + sparks
 *     │                   PhysicsSystem    (600)        Rapier 3D: ball, bob, rotor
 *     │                   pose capture    (1000)        §43's previous/current states
 *     ├─ update           this file: spring visual, labels, overlay, #status
 *     └─ render           renderer.render(scene, views, interpolationAlpha)
 * ```
 *
 * No system knows about any other; the scene graph is the only thing they
 * share. That is the §118 claim in one paragraph, and the browser gate
 * (`tests/browser/one-scene-everything-moves.spec.ts`) measures it from the
 * outside — every object in its own hue, the motion in changed pixels, the
 * controls in what they change.
 *
 * ## Backends are *selected*, not constructed (§62, §37)
 *
 * This is the first shipped example to use the auto-selection registries
 * (2026-08-07, A-8/R-2/PH-19):
 *
 * ```ts
 * registerWebglRenderer();                       // the application names its backends
 * registerRapierSolver();
 * new Application({ renderer: "auto", … });      // §62 order: WebGPU, WebGL 2, 2D
 * new PhysicsWorld({ dimension: "3d", solver: "auto", … });
 * ```
 *
 * Registration is an explicit **call** and never an import side effect: all 24
 * packages declare `"sideEffects": false`, so a bundler is entitled to delete an
 * import whose bindings are unused, and a side-effect registration module would
 * vanish on the bundler's schedule. What the page actually got is published as
 * `data-backend` / `data-solver`, and any backend `"auto"` passed over is
 * reported through the two fallback callbacks rather than swallowed (§62's
 * diagnostics event, delivered as a callback because §3.1 gives `render` and
 * `physics` no diagnostics edge).
 *
 * **What the solver registry costs, measured.** `registerRapierSolver()` names
 * *both* Rapier adapters — one registration serves both §21 dimensions, and the
 * dimension is only known when a world asks — so this bundle carries **both**
 * wasm images even though only the 3D one is ever decoded: 4.20 MB raw /
 * 1.54 MB gzip, against `examples/mechanism`'s 1.85 MB / 0.69 MB for a single
 * `new Rapier2dAdapter()`. Constructing `new Rapier3dAdapter()` here would
 * roughly halve the download; exercising the registry is the point of this
 * page, so the cost is recorded rather than avoided. A future packet that wants
 * both could split the registration per dimension.
 *
 * ## Screen space, the standard way (§46, §47, §48)
 *
 * §118 wants a *screen-space* control panel, and this page draws one the way the
 * engine now says to (R-37/R-38, adopted here 2026-08-21):
 *
 * ```text
 * defineLayer("ui")                       — §46: a name, one bit
 * uiCamera = new ScreenCamera(…)          — §47: the projection is the pixel rect
 * views = [world view, ui view]           — §48: two full-surface viewports
 * view.layerMask / uiView.layerMask       — §48: each pass draws its own layer
 * ```
 *
 * so the panel is laid out in **pixels**, drawn exactly where its layout says,
 * and picked through the camera it is drawn with. One scene, one frame, two
 * passes over one render list — the arrangement
 * `tests/integration/screen-camera.test.ts` proves end to end.
 *
 * Until 2026-08-21 the panel was instead a *child of the `PerspectiveCamera`
 * node*, floating on a plane 2.2 world units in front of it, because §48's
 * `layerMask` and §46's layer registry did not exist and a second view would
 * have drawn the whole scene twice. That workaround was honest and it was
 * approximate: every layout number was a fraction of a world unit that a comment
 * had to translate into "≈ 329 CSS pixels", and finding a button on screen took
 * a perspective divide. Both are gone.
 *
 * ## The palette is an instrument
 *
 * §66 gives this tier no material state a screenshot can read back, so the
 * browser gate attributes every pixel to an object **by hue**, the discipline
 * `examples/particles-demo` established and `examples/first-3d-scene` extended
 * to lit surfaces. Every colour below states the bytes it produces at full
 * illumination, and adjacent classifiers are kept far apart on purpose:
 *
 * | object            | fully lit bytes | the classifier that owns it        |
 * | ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
 * | cube (both checker cells) | `(255, 149, 43)` / `(149, 57, 18)` | warm: `r ≥ 140`, `r − g ≥ 55`, `r − b ≥ 70` |
 * | bouncing ball     | `(149, 128, 255)` | violet: `b ≥ 110`, `b − r ≥ 40`, `b − g ≥ 40` |
 * | pendulum bob + spring | `(71, 220, 113)` | green: `g ≥ 120`, `g − r ≥ 55`, `g − b ≥ 45` |
 * | rotor bar         | `(65, 205, 241)` | cyan: `g ≥ 120`, `b ≥ 120`, `g − r ≥ 50`, `b − r ≥ 50` |
 * | 2D orbit art (unlit) | `(242, 64, 184)` / `(173, 41, 128)` | magenta: `r ≥ 140`, `b ≥ 120`, `g ≤ r − 70` |
 * | particles         | `(255, 235, 115)` | yellow: `r ≥ 150`, `g ≥ 120`, `b ≤ 120`, `r − g ≤ 70` |
 * | glyphs            | `(240, 240, 240)` | neutral: `min ≥ 170`, `max − min ≤ 24` |
 * | debug overlay     | `(255, 255, 0)`, `(255, 128, 0)`, `(0, 255, 0)`, `(255, 0, 0)` | saturated with **no blue**: `b ≤ 12` and `max(r, g) ≥ 200` |
 * | ground slab       | `(45, 46, 54)`  | none — it is the floor, and must trip nothing |
 * | background        | `(10, 11, 17)`  | none                                  |
 *
 * The UI panel's own surfaces are deliberately warm-grey and near-neutral so
 * that no widget can be mistaken for a scene object; the one exception — the
 * near-white focus ring and slider handle — is confined to the lower-right
 * quarter where the panel sits, which is why the gate counts *world* glyphs in
 * the upper 40 % of the frame and the panel's own text below it. The measured
 * separation the horizon test rests on: ground luminance 46.4, sky 11.2.
 *
 * ## Determinism (§33)
 *
 * Every seed is a constant, nothing reads `Math.random`, and the only clock
 * this file touches is the rAF timestamp handed to `app.step` — a
 * presentation-side measurement converted to seconds before it crosses into the
 * engine (§7a). Inside `step`, every system sees the same injected
 * `fixedDeltaTime`, so two runs reaching the same simulation step hold the same
 * state.
