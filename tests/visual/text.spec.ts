/**
 * §92 visual: §49/§56's `Text` node, glyph for glyph (R-28, 2026-08-13).
 *
 * ## What a golden adds over `tests/browser/text.spec.ts`
 *
 * That gate counts ink and checks the *shape* of a two-line label, which is
 * everything a threshold can honestly say. It cannot say that the letters are
 * **the right letters**, and the failure modes it lets through are exactly the
 * ones a bitmap text tier is prone to:
 *
 * - every glyph drawn upside down (a v-flip in either the atlas packer or the
 *   quad builder — the two flips that must cancel, `glyph-atlas.ts`);
 * - every glyph one atlas cell off (a `u0`/`u1` swapped, a padding change not
 *   reflected in the uv table), which draws the same amount of ink in the same
 *   place out of the wrong cells;
 * - the whole string reversed, or a line's alignment applied to the wrong line.
 *
 * All three keep the ink count, the row structure and the draw count intact. A
 * golden does not, which is why this is the one text assertion that is a pixel
 * match.
 *
 * ## Why a golden is sound here (the category's own argument)
 *
 * The shared Playwright config forces ANGLE-over-SwiftShader unconditionally,
 * so this image is compared SwiftShader-to-SwiftShader — the same rasteriser on
 * a developer sandbox and in CI. See `ui-demo.spec.ts` for the full argument;
 * the extra condition it names is that the frame must be **static at rest**,
 * and this one is: the fixture's scene holds no clock, no animation and no
 * physics, so every rAF draws identical pixels forever.
 *
 * ## The page
 *
 * The fixture `tests/browser/fixtures/text-page.ts`, bundled with Vite's
 * JavaScript API and injected into a page served by the first site's server —
 * R-9's technique, and the reason it is shared with the `chromium` gate rather
 * than copied is that a golden of a *different* page would guard a different
 * thing.
 *
 * ## Refreshing the golden
 *
 * ```sh
 * pnpm examples:build
 * npx playwright test --project=visual --update-snapshots
 * ```
 *
 * Review the diff image Playwright writes on failure before refreshing: for
 * this spec a real diff is a text rendering bug, not anti-aliasing drift.
