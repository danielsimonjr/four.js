/**
 * R-13 — §59's `StandardMaterial` and the metallic-roughness pipeline, driving
 * the real WebGL 2 backend (2026-08-08).
 *
 * `StandardMaterial` lives in `@four/materials` and names no GL type;
 * `@four/render`'s render list turns it into a `"standard"` item; the WebGL 2
 * backend draws it through `StandardProgram`. Those are three packages
 * agreeing, and no unit test inside any one of them can check the agreement —
 * which is what this file is for. Four claims:
 *
 * 1. **A scene without a `StandardMaterial` is byte-identical.** The steady-
 *    state transcript below was recorded from the build immediately before
 *    R-13 (HEAD `e0ddd3b`) for a scene that exercises every pipeline that
 *    existed then — flat unlit, unlit + texture + vertex colours, lit under a
 *    directional light, lit + texture, and a blended sprite — and is pinned
 *    here, so this is a genuine before/after comparison rather than a
 *    restatement of what the code currently happens to do. This is the sixth
 *    run of the recorded-sequence method (R-4, R-5, R-6, F13, A-1, and now
 *    R-13).
 * 2. **The sixth program is compiled at initialization and never in a frame.**
 *    §61 forbids `render` from throwing, and a shader compile is exactly the
 *    operation that can. That is the one thing R-13 costs an application which
 *    never uses §59.
 * 3. **A standard draw really is a different pipeline, not a renamed lit one.**
 *    It switches programs, uploads the eye position a specular lobe needs, and
 *    uploads §59's own three surface parameters — while reading the *same*
 *    §68 lights the lit pipeline reads.
 * 4. **The two surface families compose in one scene.** A `LitMaterial` and a
 *    `StandardMaterial` in one render list produce one program switch each and
 *    one light collection walk between them, in scene-graph order.
 *
 * The scenes are real and only the GL context is a double, for the reason
 * `render-graph.test.ts` gives at length.
