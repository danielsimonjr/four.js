/**
 * A-4 — §85's development/production build split, proven at the bundle
 * (2026-08-07).
 *
 * §85 closes with *"Production builds may disable expensive validation while
 * preserving essential safety checks."* `@four/core`'s `DEV` is the mechanism;
 * `packages/core/tests/dev.test.ts` proves its *semantics* by evaluating both
 * builds. That is not the same claim as the one this packet actually makes,
 * which is about **bytes**: that a real bundler, given
 * `define: { __FOUR_DEV__: "false" }`, folds the guard to a literal and deletes
 * the guarded code, so §84's statistics wiring and §6a's duplicate-component
 * warning stop being shipped to users who will never read them.
 *
 * Only a bundler can answer that, so this file runs one — the same Vite the
 * examples build with, twice over the same entry, and compares.
 *
 * The second half is the rule that keeps the mechanism safe. Determinism
 * (§33–§34) is defined over the simulation and a replay recorded in a
 * development build must reproduce bit-exactly in a production one, so **no
 * value that reaches a solver, an integrator, a checksum, a snapshot, or a
 * serialized document may depend on `DEV`**. That is a prose rule, and prose
 * rules decay; {@link GATED} turns it into a list. A new file that gates on the
 * flag fails this suite until someone adds it there, which is the moment the
 * §33 argument has to be made out loud.
