/**
 * A-8 / R-2 / PH-19 — `renderer: "auto"` and `solver: "auto"`, end to end
 * (2026-08-07).
 *
 * The three gaps were filed separately and designed as one thing, because they
 * are one claim about how packages depend on each other, and that claim cannot
 * be checked inside any single package:
 *
 * 1. **A name resolves to a real backend.** `@four/render` holds a registry and
 *    imports no backend; `@four/render-webgl` registers a real `WebglRenderer`
 *    into it; `Application`, given the §45 string, ends up driving that
 *    renderer against a real GL sequence. Each package's own tests prove its
 *    half against a double — only this file puts the real ones together.
 * 2. **The same shape works for solvers.** `@four/physics` holds a registry and
 *    imports no solver; `@four/physics-rapier` registers the real adapters;
 *    `PhysicsWorld`, given `solver: "auto"`, simulates — under real wasm, with
 *    the dimension driving which adapter was built (§37's capability-driven
 *    selection).
 * 3. **Neither registry is consulted when nothing selects by name.** An
 *    application that hands over a constructed instance must resolve nothing,
 *    which is the property the whole design exists to preserve (§91) and the
 *    one a bundle-size gate can only measure after the fact.
 *
 * The GL context is a double, for the reason `packages/render-webgl/tests`
 * gives at length; Rapier is not — these worlds run the real wasm.
 *
 * Every test uses its **own** registry rather than the shared one. That is not
 * only hygiene: it is the seam that makes two independent engines in one
 * process possible, and a suite that leaned on process-wide state would pass or
 * fail depending on file order.
