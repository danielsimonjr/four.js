/**
 * Shared builders for the Phase 5 cross-integration suite (WP-5.6): one
 * headless {@link Application}, one {@link PhysicsSystem}, and real Rapier
 * worlds in both §21 dimensions.
 *
 * Everything here goes through the **public API** — `four/application`,
 * `@four/physics`, `@four/physics-rapier` — because that is what the packet is
 * for: `@four/physics` has its own structural fake solver and
 * `@four/physics-rapier` has its own wasm-backed unit tests, and neither proves
 * that the two halves compose. This file builds the composition once so each
 * case in `../physics-rapier.test.ts` states only its own physics.
 *
 * ## The one thing this file asserts by existing (§37, WP-5.5)
 *
 * {@link DimensionKit.createAdapter} is declared to return
 * `PhysicsWorldAdapter` — `@four/physics`'s `PhysicsSolverAdapter &
 * SolverBodyAccess` — and {@link KIT_2D} and {@link KIT_3D} return a
 * `Rapier2dAdapter` and a `Rapier3dAdapter` from it. `@four/physics-rapier`
 * declares its own `RapierBodyAccess` (it may not import `@four/physics`), so
 * the two per-handle interfaces are only *structurally* identical, and nothing
 * had checked the 3D one. These two functions are that check: if
 * `Rapier3dAdapter` drifted from `SolverBodyAccess` by one signature,
 * `tests/tsconfig.json`'s `tsc --noEmit` would fail here rather than in a
 * runtime surprise. The `PHYSICS_WORLD_ADAPTERS` constant below states it a
 * second time in a form that cannot be optimized away by a reader.
 *
 * ## Conventions this file obeys (plan §1)
 *
 * Y-up in both dimensions, radians, **seconds** everywhere, and no clock and no
 * `Math.random` anywhere in a scenario (§33): every run is driven by
 * `Application.step(DT)` with a constant, injected delta.
