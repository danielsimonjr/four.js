/**
 * The Phase 10 replay rig (plan §6i, WP-10.4; §33–34, §113) — one headless
 * 2D Rapier scenario with scripted inputs, plus **the `ReplayTarget` wrapper an
 * application is meant to copy**.
 *
 * `@four/diagnostics` records and replays through a duck-typed contract
 * ({@link ReplayTarget}: `checksum`, `createSnapshot`, `restoreSnapshot`, and an
 * optional `applyInput`) because it may depend on `core`, `math` and `scene`
 * only and therefore cannot name `PhysicsWorld` (plan P10-1, §6h). This file is
 * the other end of that contract: the composition an application performs to
 * make its own simulation recordable.
 *
 * ## The wrapper pattern, and why there is a wrapper at all
 *
 * `PhysicsWorld` **already satisfies `ReplayTarget`** — three of the four
 * members are its own public methods with matching signatures, and the fourth is
 * optional. {@link PHYSICS_WORLD_AS_REPLAY_TARGET} states exactly that as a
 * compiling assignment, so a drift in either declaration fails
 * `pnpm typecheck:tests` here.
 *
 * What `PhysicsWorld` does *not* have — and should not have — is
 * `applyInput(step, payload)`. A solver world has no idea what an application's
 * inputs *are*: "thrust 0.4", "jump", "spawn a crate" are the application's
 * vocabulary, and §34 stores them as opaque JSON precisely so the engine never
 * has to have an opinion about them. So the target an application records is
 * **its world plus its own input decoder**, which is what
 * {@link PhysicsReplayTarget} is: a three-line delegation to `PhysicsWorld` for
 * the §34 members, and one honest `applyInput` that turns a recorded JSON
 * payload back into the §26 call host script made live
 * (`RigidBody.applyImpulse`).
 *
 * Three properties make the pattern worth copying rather than re-inventing:
 *
 * 1. **One code path for live and replayed input.** The live run calls
 *    {@link PhysicsReplayTarget.applyInput} too (see {@link runRecordedRun}) —
 *    it does not apply impulses one way and replay them another. A decoder bug
 *    therefore breaks the *recording* as loudly as it breaks the replay, instead
 *    of hiding until someone opens a `.replay.json` six months later.
 * 2. **The payload is validated on the way back in.** `applyInput` receives
 *    `JsonValue`, not the application's type: the document may have come off
 *    disk. {@link decodeImpulseInput} is the narrowing, and it throws rather
 *    than silently applying a zero impulse (§42's "warn rather than silently
 *    overwrite" instinct, applied to input).
 * 3. **The two snapshot declarations are checked against each other.**
 *    `createSnapshot` returns `PhysicsWorld`'s `PhysicsSnapshot` where a
 *    `ReplaySnapshot` is demanded — that direction compiles as written, and
 *    a drift in either declaration fails `pnpm typecheck:tests`. The consume
 *    direction does **not**, and saying it did was this header's own bug until
 *    2026-08-21: `ReplaySnapshot.configuration` is `unknown` where
 *    `PhysicsSnapshot.configuration` is `PhysicsSnapshotConfiguration`, for the
 *    package-boundary reason {@link asPhysicsSnapshot} records. That helper is
 *    the narrowing, and it is not trusted — §34's own refusal is.
 *
 * ## The stepping seam (WP-10.2's stated cost, exercised here)
 *
 * `ReplayPlayer` takes `stepFn` — "advance the host world by one fixed step" —
 * separately from `target`, and **nothing type-checks that the two describe the
 * same world**. {@link createReplayRig} therefore hands out both together
 * ({@link ReplayRig.target} and {@link ReplayRig.stepOnce}) so an application
 * that copies this file gets the pairing right by construction;
 * `../physics-replay.test.ts` also crosses the pairing on purpose, once, to show
 * what the failure actually looks like (a clean run and a `false` from
 * `verifyChecksum`, never a throw).
 *
 * ## Conventions (plan §1)
 *
 * Y-up (2D gravity is negative Y, §7a), radians, **seconds** everywhere, no
 * clock and no `Math.random` anywhere in a scenario (§33): every run is driven
 * by `Application.step(DT)` with a constant, injected delta, and every scripted
 * input is a pure function of the step index.
