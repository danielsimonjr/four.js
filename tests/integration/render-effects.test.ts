/**
 * R-6 — §70's full-screen effects, driving the real WebGL 2 backend
 * (2026-08-07).
 *
 * `EffectRenderPass` lives in `@four/render` and names no GL type; the WebGL 2
 * backend runs it; `RenderGraph` orders it against the scene passes that
 * produce its input. Those are three packages agreeing, and no unit test
 * inside any one of them can check the agreement — which is what this file is
 * for. Four claims:
 *
 * 1. **The no-post path is byte-identical.** An application that runs no
 *    effect must emit the GL call sequence it emitted before §70 existed —
 *    same calls, same arguments, same order. The expected transcript below was
 *    recorded from the build immediately before R-6 (commit `9285d4b`) and is
 *    pinned here, so this is a genuine before/after comparison rather than a
 *    restatement of what the code currently happens to do.
 * 2. **The graph is still a driver, not a backend.** A graph whose last pass
 *    is an effect emits exactly what the hand-written
 *    `render` + `renderEffect` pair emits, call for call — R-5's property,
 *    re-proved for the second verb.
 * 3. **The static rule and the runtime refusal are the same rule.** A pass
 *    that draws into the surface it samples is reported `"feedback"` by
 *    `validate()` and then not drawn by the backend, on one graph.
 * 4. **A ping-pong chain really composes.** Two effects and a present pass
 *    over two targets: three draws, three framebuffer bindings, one on-screen
 *    pass, and a clean validation.
 *
 * The scenes are real and only the GL context is a double, for the reason
 * `render-graph.test.ts` gives at length.
