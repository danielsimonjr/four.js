/**
 * §77a / RFC 0004 — painted pixels are **display content, never simulation
 * input**, and the §96 boundary that keeps untrusted content from ever
 * becoming a paint source (2026-08-29).
 *
 * This is §40's display-only rule with one word changed — "inexact" becomes
 * "unreproducible" — and this file is the direct analogue of
 * `units-display.test.ts`, which is that rule's enforcement. Host-rendered
 * raster output is not reproducible: font rasterization, anti-aliasing, and
 * GPU-backed `getImageData` all differ by platform, browser, and driver, so a
 * fixed step, a §33 checksum, a §34 snapshot, or a replay document that read a
 * painted pixel would make §34's replay guarantee false on every platform at
 * once. The rule (§77a):
 *
 * > No value derived from a `RasterSource`, a `CanvasTexture`, or a
 * > `CanvasViewWidget`'s content may reach a fixed step, a §33 checksum, a §34
 * > snapshot, or a replay document.
 *
 * ## What is enforced, and the honest limit of it
 *
 * **This is a reachability rule, not a readability rule.** The scan below
 * fails any package source outside {@link ALLOWED} that names the raster
 * module — most simulation packages cannot see `@four/render` at all under
 * the frozen §3.1 matrix, and the scan states the rule for the ones that
 * could and for every package added later. What it cannot enforce:
 * `MaterialTexture.data` is public (the upload path reads it), so an
 * application that reads `canvasTexture.data` and branches its own fixed-step
 * logic on a pixel has broken its own determinism — the engine documents
 * that; no test can prevent it.
 *
 * ## The §96 half
 *
 * A `RasterSource.paint` is **application code the application imported** — a
 * function value, passed to a constructor. It is not loaded content, it is
 * not named by a scene document, and `CanvasTexture` accepts no URL and no
 * module specifier — RFC 0002's plugin rule in a second place, asserted here
 * the same two ways: `@ts-expect-error` that the constructor admits no string
 * (`pnpm typecheck:tests` runs it), and the scan's guarantee that neither
 * `@four/serialization` nor `@four/assets` — the two packages that touch
 * §96's untrusted content — can reach the raster module at all. §77a's "no
 * §79 representation" is what makes the second half true by construction: a
 * painted surface has no key, so no document can name one.
