/**
 * §26/§27 force fields reach rigid bodies — and `@four/particles`' §27 field set
 * is the same contract (PH-8, 2026-08-09).
 *
 * `@four/physics` declares `ForceField` and `@four/particles` declares
 * `ParticleForceField`. Both are §27's interface transcribed member-for-member,
 * and the frozen §3.1 dependency matrix has no edge between the two packages —
 * so **nothing type-checks the two declarations against each other except a
 * file that can import both**. This is that file, exactly as
 * `tests/determinism/phase9-particles.test.ts` is the one place `ParticleSystem`
 * can be checked against `@four/motion`'s `SimulationSystem`.
 *
 * The claim being pinned has four parts:
 *
 * 1. **Assignability.** Every built-in field factory in `@four/particles`
 *    produces a value assignable to `@four/physics`' `ForceField`, with no
 *    adapter, no cast and no import in either direction. The assignment happens
 *    in ordinary source, so `tsc` (via `tests/tsconfig.json` and `pnpm run
 *    docs`) is the real check and the runtime assertions only confirm the
 *    values arrive.
 * 2. **The units mean what §41 says.** A particle field authored as an
 *    acceleration accelerates a 1 kg and a 7 kg body equally when registered as
 *    `"acceleration"`, and in a 7:1 ratio when registered as `"force"` — which
 *    is the whole reason the units are a required argument rather than a
 *    documented convention.
 * 3. **§27's volume inclusion needs nothing new**: `volumeField` wraps a
 *    physics-side field as happily as a particle-side one, because inclusion is
 *    a property of a field rather than of the system that samples it.
 * 4. **A registered-but-empty generator changes nothing** — the §33 half of
 *    "this packet moves no existing golden", stated as an equality of two real
 *    solver checksums rather than as an argument.
 *
 * The worlds run on the real Rapier 2D adapter rather than a double: the point
 * of the packet is that a §27 field moves a *solver's* body, and a fake
 * integrator could not tell an applied force from a wished-for one. World
 * gravity is switched off in every world here so that the only thing moving a
 * body is the field under test.
