/**
 * §96's *"safe shader/plugin boundaries"*, stated exactly and then enforced
 * (A-3 / RFC 0002 §6, 2026-08-28).
 *
 * ## The posture, in one paragraph
 *
 * A plugin is JavaScript the application imported. It runs with the
 * application's authority, and **nothing in this repository sandboxes it**. A
 * sandbox would mean Workers or realms plus a serialisable message boundary for
 * every registry a capability hands over, which is a project in itself and
 * would change the shape of all six tokens. So the boundary §96 asks for is not
 * "a plugin is contained"; it is:
 *
 * > **Untrusted content can never become a plugin.** A plugin is a *value* the
 * > application passes to `PluginHost.add` or `ApplicationOptions.plugins` —
 * > never a URL, never a module specifier, never a name resolved out of a
 * > document. No deserialization path may reach the plugin host.
 *
 * That claim is mechanically enforceable, so it is enforced here rather than
 * asserted in prose — the discipline `A-23` established for the CSP claim and
 * `A-2` for the §40 units allowlist. Two checks, matching RFC 0002 §6's own
 * list:
 *
 * 1. **No deserializing package can reach the host.** Nothing under
 *    `@four/serialization` or `@four/assets` — the two packages that turn
 *    external bytes into engine objects — names the plugin host at all. The
 *    allowlist is visible below and editing it is deliberately a visible act.
 * 2. **`add` admits no string.** The parameter type is `FourPlugin`, so a
 *    module specifier is a compile error, not a runtime check somebody can
 *    forget. `@ts-expect-error` is the assertion, and `pnpm typecheck:tests`
 *    is what runs it.
 *
 * The second half of §96's phrase — safe **shader** boundaries — is answered by
 * RFC 0001, not here: shading is a graph of closed operators, so a plugin
 * supplying shading supplies data, and supplying a new *operator* is explicitly
 * out of scope in both RFCs.
