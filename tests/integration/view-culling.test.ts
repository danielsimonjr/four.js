/**
 * R-8 — §64's per-view render lists and §87's frustum culling, across the four
 * packages that have to agree on them (2026-08-09).
 *
 * Before this packet the frame built **one** render list and every viewport
 * drew all of it, filtered by a bitmask the backend tested inline. §64 asks the
 * renderer to separate "visibility and layer filtering" from "frustum and
 * occlusion culling" and to do both per view; §87 asks for culling and had no
 * world bounds to cull against; §49's `frustumCulled` was absent because there
 * was nothing for it to switch off; §66's key 4 was blocked because a depth
 * measured along one camera would have misordered every other view of the same
 * list. All four are one structural change, and no unit test inside one package
 * can check it: `@four/math` owns the planes, `@four/geometry` the local box,
 * `@four/render` the derivation, `@four/render-webgl` the only place it becomes
 * GL, and `four` the §79 document.
 *
 * Six claims:
 *
 * 1. **A scene with nothing off screen is byte-identical.** A cull that removes
 *    nothing must leave the GL transcript exactly as it was, because the
 *    derived list is a *subsequence* — the same pooled items, in the same
 *    order. `FRAME_BEFORE_R8` is a recording taken on the reverted build, not a
 *    wish.
 * 2. **A cull removes exactly the draws that had no pixels.** The frame that
 *    used to submit them submits everything else, in the same order.
 * 3. **Two views of one frame disagree**, which is the whole point of a
 *    per-view list: one traversal, two answers.
 * 4. **The shadow pass stays view-independent** (R-18's §46 argument): a caster
 *    no camera can see still occludes, because §69's map is built from the
 *    frame's list before the view loop.
 * 5. **§66's key 4 sorts a view's own list** — opaque near to far, transparent
 *    far to near — and is a verb, never a default.
 * 6. **`frustumCulled` survives §79.**
