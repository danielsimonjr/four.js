/**
 * Phase 5 cross-integration: `@four/physics` **driven through a real Rapier
 * solver**, in both §21 dimensions, through the public API only (WP-5.6;
 * §29–§30, §33–§34, §42–§43, §108).
 *
 * This is the first suite in `tests/integration/` (§92's backlog item), and it
 * exists because the two halves of Phase 5 are separately tested and nowhere
 * *composed*: `packages/physics/tests/` drives `PhysicsWorld` against a
 * structural fake solver, and `packages/physics-rapier/tests/` drives the two
 * adapters against the real wasm without a scene, a node, an authority, or an
 * application. Everything below therefore goes through
 * `four/application` + `@four/physics` + `@four/physics-rapier` and never
 * reaches into a package's internals: an `Application` is composed headlessly
 * the way `tests/determinism/*` compose one, a `PhysicsSystem` is registered on
 * it, and worlds are built on real `Rapier2dAdapter` / `Rapier3dAdapter`
 * instances and initialized with `await world.initialize()`.
 *
 * ## What "matches the closed form" means here (§10, WP-5.4/5.5)
 *
 * Rapier 0.19.3 integrates one `World.step` as four substeps of `dt / 4`, so
 * free fall follows `y = y₀ + g·h²·K(K+1)/2` with `h = dt/4` and `K = 4N`, and
 * `v = g·dt·N`. That derivation is the adapters' own, verified there against
 * the wasm; `helpers/physics-scenarios.ts` re-exports it as `fallDistance` /
 * `fallVelocity` rather than restating it. The tolerances below are absolute
 * and documented at each assertion — Rapier stores state in 32-bit floats, so
 * a few hundred substeps accumulate ~1e-5 of drift, and the engine adds nothing
 * to that: `PhysicsWorld` copies the solver's pose onto the node unchanged.
 *
 * ## What this suite deliberately does not do
 *
 * It does not pin a golden digest. §33's cross-process golden for Phase 5 is
 * WP-5.8's packet (`tests/determinism/`), and duplicating it here would create
 * a second file to update whenever Rapier's version pin moves. What this file
 * pins instead is the *property*: two identical runs agree step by step, a
 * divergent run does not, and a restored snapshot re-derives the continuation
 * exactly (§34's strong replay property).
