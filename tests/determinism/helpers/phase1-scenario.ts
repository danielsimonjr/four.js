/**
 * The Phase 1 exit scenario (§104 exit criterion, §33 determinism, plan
 * WP-1.14) — one headless run of a 100-node scene stepped 1000 times, reduced
 * to a handful of uint32 checksums.
 *
 * §104's exit criterion is "a scene graph can be deterministically stepped
 * without a renderer". This module *is* that sentence, executable: it builds an
 * {@link Application} (scene + fixed-step scheduler + §39 system registry, no
 * renderer anywhere in the import graph), registers a system that mutates
 * transforms from the injected `TimeState` and from seeded RNG streams, drives
 * 1000 host-injected frames with a ragged
 * elapsed sequence, and checksums every world matrix after every frame.
 *
 * ## Why this file is `.ts` and imported by *both* runtimes
 *
 * The determinism gate (plan §8) demands the same scenario run twice
 * in-process **and** once in a fresh `node` child process. Those two runs are
 * only evidence if they execute *identical code*, so the scenario lives in one
 * file that both can load:
 *
 * - **Vitest** loads it through Vite, as it loads any `.ts` under `tests/`.
 * - **Plain `node`** loads it directly: this repository pins Node ≥ 20 and runs
 *   on Node 22.22 (`process.features.typescript === "strip"`), where
 *   type-stripping is on by default, and bare `@four/*` specifiers resolve from
 *   this file's directory up to the workspace `node_modules` symlinks into each
 *   package's built `dist`.
 *
 * The packet's fallback suggestion — write the scenario as a `.mjs` runner and
 * have the `.ts` test import that — was rejected because it would put the
 * scenario outside TypeScript entirely (no `strict` checking of the very code
 * that defines the golden values) for a portability problem that this Node
 * version does not have. The cost of the choice is recorded honestly: **this
 * file must stay within Node's erasable-syntax subset** — type annotations,
 * `interface`, `type`, and `import type` are fine; `enum`, `namespace`,
 * constructor parameter properties, and decorators are not. Nothing here needs
 * them. If a future Node/toolchain change breaks direct `.ts` loading, the fix
 * is a build step or a `.mjs` transpile of this file — not two copies of the
 * scenario.
 *
 * ## Determinism tier reached (§33)
 *
 * **`same-runtime`**, which is §33's stated initial target and exactly what the
 * Phase 1 exit needs. Everything that *selects* behaviour here is exact integer
 * arithmetic — a 32-bit LCG through `Math.imul`, so structure, the elapsed
 * sequence, and every random increment are bit-identical on any engine. The
 * arithmetic that *computes* transforms is not: `Quaternion.setFromAxisAngle`
 * calls `Math.sin`/`Math.cos`, whose results may legally differ between JS
 * engines, which is precisely the hazard §33 names for the `same-platform`
 * tier. A rotation driven by `simulationTime` is what the packet specifies and
 * what a scene graph actually does, so the transcendental stays and the tier is
 * documented rather than hidden. The checksum itself (D6) is exact and
 * cross-platform; only its inputs are runtime-bound.
 *
 * ## What the scenario deliberately exercises
 *
 * | Phase 1 mechanism | how it is reached |
 * |---|---|
 * | fixed-step accumulator (§10) | 1000 ragged frames, 0..5 fixed steps each |
 * | sub-step clamp + `droppedTime` (§9, §10) | two 0.5 s frames (indices 249, 749) |
 * | §39 system registry ordering | the mutator registers at `PRIORITY_KINEMATICS` |
 * | dirty/version propagation (§7) | every node mutated every fixed step |
 * | world-transform resolution (§7) | `Application`'s `onUpdate` resolve, read in `update` |
 * | mixed hierarchy depth (§6) | LCG-chosen chains, star hubs, and new roots |
 * | insertion-order traversal (§33) | `Scene.traverse`, depth-first, insertion order |

 *   immediately as a diverged checksum, which is exactly what the clamp frames
