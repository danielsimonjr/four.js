/**
 * Phase 9 determinism test (plan §6h P9-4, WP-9.4; §112, §36, §27, §33, §92).
 *
 * §112 closes Phase 9 on scale and rendering — *"≥100,000 simple particles
 * simulated and rendered at interactive rates"* — and plan §6h splits the
 * evidence three ways: `benchmarks/particles-100k.mjs` records the 100 000-
 * particle CPU cost, `tests/browser/particles.spec.ts` shows a system reaching a
 * real framebuffer and responding to a user, and **this file** discharges P9-4:
 * *"§36 emitters use SeededRandom; particle iteration insertion order; a
 * determinism golden pins a 100-particle scenario"*.
 *
 * It follows the four forms WP-1.14, WP-2.7, WP-4.8, WP-5.8, WP-6.6 and WP-7.7
 * established:
 *
 * 1. **Headless.** The scenario imports `@four/particles`, `@four/motion`,
 *    `@four/math`, `@four/diagnostics` and `four/application` — no renderer
 *    package, no canvas, no DOM. As in the phases before it the application
 *    comes from the `four/application` subpath, so "nothing renderer-shaped is
 *    loaded" is a property of the import graph and not only of behaviour. The
 *    presentation *repack* is still exercised: a `ParticleRenderable` is in the
 *    scene and `updateParticleInstances()` is called every step, exactly as
 *    `buildRenderList` would, and its output is hashed separately.
 * 2. **Deterministic in-process.** Two independent runs in one process — each on
 *    its own emitter and its own seeded stream — produce byte-identical per-step
 *    digests and identical records.
 * 3. **Deterministic across processes, against a committed golden.** A fresh
 *    `node` child process — new heap, new module graph, new JIT state — running
 *    *the same helper file* reproduces the same 600 digests and matches
 *    `golden/phase9.json`.
 * 4. **Correct where correctness is checkable without re-deriving the engine.**
 *    The pool really saturates and really drops spawns; particles really bounce
 *    off §36's plane; the seeded stream really advanced by four draws per
 *    spawned particle; and the ramps really moved.
 *
 * ## The cross-package check only this file can make
 *
 * `@four/particles` may not import `@four/motion` (the §3.1 matrix), so
 * `ParticleSystem` implements §39's `SimulationSystem` **structurally** and
 * restates `PRIORITY_FORCES` as its own `PRIORITY_PARTICLES` — the same
 * arrangement `ParticleRenderable` has with `@four/render`'s `ParticleDrawable`.
 * Nothing type-checks those declarations against each other, in either
 * direction. This suite is the one place in the repository that can, because the
 * root `tests/` project sees every package:
 *
 * - **assignability**, by *registering* the system on a real `SystemRegistry`
 *   (the scenario does this, and a `ParticleSystem` that did not satisfy §39
 *   would fail to compile here or throw at registration); and
 * - **the constant**, by comparing `PRIORITY_PARTICLES` against the imported
 *   `PRIORITY_FORCES` — the assertion below is the reason the duplicate is safe
 *   to keep.
 *
 * ## What the golden pins beyond three hashes
 *
 * A hash says "something changed" and nothing else. So the golden also carries
 * five readable counts — spawned, dropped, final live, bounces, peak live —
 * which say *what kind* of change a red test found: a changed emission
 * schedule, a changed capacity policy, a lost collision, or a genuinely
 * different trajectory under the same schedule. The per-step digests localise it
 * to a step.
 *
 * ## The golden file is immutable
 *
 * `golden/phase9.json` is evidence, not configuration. **Never regenerate it to
 * make this test pass.** A mismatch is a real finding: engine behaviour changed
 * between the run that produced the golden and the run under test. The correct
 * response is to identify the change and decide whether it is intended — and
 * only then, as a reviewed and recorded decision (CHANGELOG.md, MEMORY.md),
 * write new values.
 *
 * ## Why the child process runs a `.ts` file directly
 *
 * Identical to every phase before: the in-process and fresh-process runs must
 * execute the same code, so both load `helpers/phase9-scenario.ts` — Vitest
 * through Vite, plain `node` through its default type-stripping (Node ≥ 22.18;
 * this repo pins Node ≥ 20 and runs 22.22). The child is launched with
 * `--input-type=module -e`, importing the helper by absolute `file:` URL, so
 * there is no second runner file to drift out of sync with this one.
