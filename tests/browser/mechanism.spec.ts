/**
 * Phase 6 browser gate: §109's *"constraints remain stable under expected
 * real-time loads"*, measured from outside the page (plan WP-6.6).
 *
 * `tests/determinism/phase6-joints.test.ts` proves the joint pillar is
 * deterministic; `tests/integration/physics-joints.test.ts` proves each §28
 * joint matches its closed form. Neither answers the question §109 actually
 * asks, which is whether a *mechanism* — a closed kinematic loop with one
 * degree of freedom, driven by a motor, held together by three hinges and a
 * slider and loaded by a spring — keeps running in a browser, at a real frame
 * rate, while a user reconfigures it. Those are the things this file measures,
 * in `examples/mechanism` — §109's demonstration — through Chromium's real
 * framebuffer and Playwright's real mouse.
 *
 * ```text
 * page load → Rapier wasm init → PhysicsSystem (1 "2d" world, 6 joints)
 *   → fixed-step accumulator → node transforms → WebglRenderer → pixels
 *                                    ↑
 *   Chromium mouse → PointerInput → pick → HingeJoint.setMotor / enableMotor
 * ```
 *
 * ## The third site
 *
 * This spec drives a **third** server: `playwright.config.ts` runs one
 * `vite preview` per built example, `first-2d-scene` on 4173 (the suite's
 * `baseURL`), `physics-playground` on 4174 and `mechanism` on 4175.
 * {@link MECHANISM_URL} restates that port for the reason the scene constants
 * below are restated rather than imported — see "Method notes". Run
 * `pnpm mechanism:build` before `pnpm test:browser`, or the preview server has
 * no `dist` to serve.
 *
 * ## What is measured, and against what
 *
 * | test | §  | assertion |
 * | ---- | -- | --------- |
 * | loads | §109 | `#status` reaches `data-state="running"`, i.e. the wasm decoded and the loop started |
 * | steady operation | §28, §109 | both limit-switch counters climb, both lamps are *seen* latched, the mechanism's pixels change every frame while the control panel and the background do not change at all |
 * | motor toggle | §28 | a click releases the motor (`data-motor="off"`, the plate repaints), the mechanism coasts to less than half its driven switch cadence, and a second click restores it |
 * | speed control | §28 | two clicks on `+` raise the commanded rate, the switch cadence rises with it by more than a third, and two clicks on `−` bring both back |
 *
 * Every threshold below states the number the reference run measured and how
 * much margin the threshold leaves. Nothing here is a golden image: the gate
 * runs on SwiftShader, whose rasterisation differs from a GPU's, so every
 * assertion is a measurement with margin (§92).
 *
 * ## Method notes
 *
 * The scene's numbers are **restated** from the example rather than imported,
 * for the reason `smoothness.spec.ts`, `interaction.spec.ts` and
 * `playground.spec.ts` give: a browser gate checks the built page from the
 * outside, and importing the example's constants would let a wrong scene agree
 * with a wrong expectation.
 *
 * The PNG decoder is a copy of `example.spec.ts`'s, as in every other spec
 * here: Playwright returns an encoded screenshot, comparing compressed bytes
 * would conflate "the picture changed" with "the encoder picked different
 * filters", the workspace pins no image library, and this packet's file scope
 * forbids editing a sibling spec to share one.
 *
 * The **primary** signal in this file is the example's own data attributes —
 * `data-left-hits`, `data-right-hits`, `data-motor`, `data-target`,
 * `data-spin` — because they are what a limit switch *is* on that page: a
 * position sample latched in application code, mirrored onto `#status` on
 * purpose (the example says so itself). The pixel measurements corroborate
 * them: an attribute says the mechanism's state changed, the framebuffer says
 * the change reached the screen, and only both together say the mechanism runs.
