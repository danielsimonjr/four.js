/**
 * §65 batching against a real WebGL 2 driver (R-9, 2026-08-09) — the pixel
 * half of the packet the fake-GL suites prove the call sequence of.
 *
 * ## What only a browser can answer
 *
 * `packages/render-webgl/tests` proves the GL *sequence* a batch issues and
 * `tests/integration/render-batching.test.ts` proves the *stream* it uploads is
 * the world-space geometry of the draws it replaced. Neither rasterises
 * anything. The claim left over is the one §65 exists for and the one a fake
 * context cannot make: **merging N draws into one produces the same picture**.
 * GL's guarantee that primitives within a draw call rasterise in submission
 * order — and therefore blend, depth-test and depth-write in that order — is a
 * property of the driver, so it is checked here, on the same
 * ANGLE-over-SwiftShader rasteriser every other gate in this directory uses.
 *
 * ## Why this spec builds its own page
 *
 * Every other browser gate drives a built site in `examples/`. This one has no
 * site to drive: batching is opt-in per renderer (`gl-batch.ts` records why),
 * and adding a tenth example — plus a tenth preview server — to demonstrate one
 * renderer field would cost the suite a server and the repository a page nobody
 * would visit. So the fixture (`fixtures/batching-page.ts`) is bundled here with
 * Vite's JavaScript API and injected into a page served by the first site's
 * server, which supplies the `http:` origin a WebGL context wants.
 *
 * The build is the fixture's own, not a copy of an example's config: the only
 * thing it needs is workspace resolution, and it deliberately leaves
 * `__FOUR_DEV__` undefined so the fixture runs the development build (A-4's
 * default) rather than the shipped one.
 *
 * ## The comparison, and its tolerance
 *
 * The probe renders one scene twice into one canvas and reads the framebuffer
 * back inside each call. The two frames are **not** required to be bit-equal,
 * and `batch.ts` says why: a batch has one model matrix, so world transforms
 * are baked on the CPU instead of being applied by the vertex stage, and the
 * two evaluations of the same product differ in the last bits. What is asserted
 * is that the difference is confined to anti-aliased edges — {@link
 * MAX_DIFFERING_PIXELS} of the canvas, none of them by more than
 * {@link MAX_CHANNEL_DELTA} per channel — which is the same allowance
 * `tests/visual/` gives a Chromium version bump, and orders of magnitude
 * tighter than the difference a *misordered* or *misplaced* batch would make.
 *
 * **Measured on the first run (2026-08-09, ANGLE/SwiftShader): 0 of 76 800
 * pixels differ, over 25 717 non-background pixels, with the sprite row spun
 * about +Z so the batch bakes a rotation.** The allowance above is kept
 * nonetheless — it is a statement about what the design guarantees, not about
 * what this rasteriser happened to produce, and a run that starts needing it is
 * still a run that batched correctly.
