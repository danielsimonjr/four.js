/**
 * The page `tests/browser/skinning.spec.ts` drives — §54's GPU skinning
 * against a **real** WebGL 2 context (RFC 0003, 2026-08-28).
 *
 * Not an example and not served: the spec bundles this file with Vite's
 * JavaScript API and injects it — `clipping-page.ts`'s argument, unchanged,
 * plus this packet's own: no example calls `registerSkinningPipeline()`, and
 * that is deliberate (the pipeline-cost law — a build that never skins
 * carries none of the skinned programs), so the registered path can only be
 * proven on a page built for it.
 *
 * It publishes exactly one function on `window`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * fourSkinningProbe(angle: number): { pixels: number[]; drawCalls: number }
 * ```
 *
 * which rotates the rig's second bone by `angle` about +Z, renders, and reads
 * the framebuffer back inside the same call.
 *
 * ## The scene is the deformation claim, and nothing else
 *
 * One orange column, two stacked quads: the lower quad's four vertices follow
 * joint 0 (the root bone, at the mesh origin), the upper quad's follow joint
 * 1 (a child bone at `y = 1.5`), each with full weight — §53's
 * `joints`/`weights` at their fixed locations, through the ordinary geometry
 * cache. The inverse bind matrices put the rig's rest pose exactly where the
 * vertices are authored, so at `angle = 0` the column stands upright, and at
 * `angle = −π/2` the upper segment swings to the right about the elbow —
 * pixels appear in a region the bind pose cannot produce, and vanish from one
 * only the bind pose fills. That double displacement, measured in world
 * rectangles, is what separates "the vertex stage skinned" from every
 * bind-pose failure mode (an ignored palette, an identity skin matrix, a
 * skipped upload) — any of those renders the same picture at both angles.
