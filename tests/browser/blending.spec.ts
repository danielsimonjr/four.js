/**
 * Phase 7 browser gate: §110's *"a character or machine can move between
 * animated, kinematic, and physical control without abrupt discontinuities"*,
 * measured from outside the page (plan WP-7.7).
 *
 * `tests/determinism/phase7-blending.test.ts` proves §19's blend pipeline is
 * deterministic, and `tests/integration/physics-blending.test.ts` proves each of
 * §19's four worked examples matches its closed form. Neither answers the
 * question §110 actually asks, which is whether a *character* — an articulated
 * chain driven by a looping clip, handed to a solver on a click, and blended
 * back onto an animation that never stopped — keeps looking continuous in a
 * browser, at a real frame rate, while a user cycles its control mode. That is
 * what this file measures, in `examples/blending` — §110's demonstration —
 * through Chromium's real framebuffer and Playwright's real mouse.
 *
 * ```text
 * page load → Rapier wasm init → 3 systems (capture 299, animation 300, physics 600)
 *   → fixed-step accumulator → §19 blend → node transforms → WebglRenderer → pixels
 *                                    ↑
 *   Chromium mouse → PointerInput → pick → world.setBodyControlMode / §19 weights
 * ```
 *
 * ## The fourth site
 *
 * This spec drives a **fourth** server: `playwright.config.ts` runs one
 * `vite preview` per built example, `first-2d-scene` on 4173 (the suite's
 * `baseURL`), `physics-playground` on 4174, `mechanism` on 4175 and `blending`
 * on 4176. {@link BLENDING_URL} restates that port for the reason the scene
 * constants below are restated rather than imported — see "Method notes". Run
 * `pnpm blending:build` before `pnpm test:browser`, or the preview server has no
 * `dist` to serve.
 *
 * ## What is measured, and against what
 *
 * | test | §  | assertion |
 * | ---- | -- | --------- |
 * | loads | §45, §110 | `#status` reaches `data-state="running"` and the page starts in `data-mode="animated"` with no cycles behind it |
 * | ANIMATED | §16, §19 | a few framebuffer pairs show the chain's band changing while the ground slab and an empty corner of background do not change **at all**; the wave's span is read from `data-chain-y` until it is met |
 * | RAGDOLL | §19, §22, §110 | a click on the MODE plate reaches `data-mode="ragdoll"`, the plate repaints, and `data-chain-y` *descends* past the floor line without a teleport |
 * | RECOVER | §19, §110 | a second click reaches `"recovering"` and then `"animated"`, the sweep really takes its 1.5 s rather than snapping, the cycle counter increments, and `data-chain-y` is back inside the wave's band and swinging |
 *
 * Every threshold below states the number the reference run measured and how
 * much margin the threshold leaves. Nothing here is a golden image: the gate
 * runs on SwiftShader, whose rasterisation differs from a GPU's, so every
 * assertion is a measurement with margin (§92).
 *
 * ## Method notes
 *
 * The scene's numbers are **restated** from the example rather than imported,
 * for the reason `smoothness.spec.ts`, `interaction.spec.ts`,
 * `playground.spec.ts` and `mechanism.spec.ts` give: a browser gate checks the
 * built page from the outside, and importing the example's constants would let a
 * wrong scene agree with a wrong expectation.
 *
 * The PNG decoder is a copy of `example.spec.ts`'s, as in every other spec here:
 * Playwright returns an encoded screenshot, comparing compressed bytes would
 * conflate "the picture changed" with "the encoder picked different filters",
 * the workspace pins no image library, and this packet's file scope forbids
 * editing a sibling spec to share one.
 *
 * The **primary** signal in this file is split, on purpose. The page's own data
 * attributes — `data-mode`, `data-cycles`, `data-weight`, `data-entry`,
 * `data-step`, `data-worst`, `data-chain-y` — say what §19 did, because they are
 * the engine-side quantities §110 is stated over (`data-entry` and `data-step`
 * are per-*fixed-step* node displacements, which no screenshot cadence can
 * measure). The pixel measurements say that it reached the screen: an attribute
 * claims the chain collapsed, the framebuffer shows its bright pixels two world
 * units lower, and only both together say the demonstration works. Note that
 * `dataset["chainY"]` in the example is the attribute **`data-chain-y`** — the
 * DOM's own camelCase-to-dashed mapping, and a real trap when reading a page
 * from outside.
