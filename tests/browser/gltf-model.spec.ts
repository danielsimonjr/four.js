/**
 * `examples/gltf-model` — §78's loader, demonstrated and gated.
 *
 * The example exists because §78 shipped tested but undemonstrated; this gate
 * exists so the demonstration cannot rot into a page that loads nothing. It
 * asserts the two claims the example is there to make: that the document AND
 * the external buffer beside it were fetched and assembled into live nodes, and
 * that the result actually reaches the screen.
 *
 * 4183 is restated verbatim from `playwright.config.ts`'s `GLTF_MODEL_PORT`,
 * for the reason every sibling spec restates its own port: the config owns the
 * server, and a spec that imported from it would couple the two files for one
 * number.
