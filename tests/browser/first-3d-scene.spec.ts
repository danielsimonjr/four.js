/**
 * Browser gate for §93's **first 3D scene** — the first browser-level evidence
 * that four.js's 3D tier draws (2026-08-07, `docs/AUDIT-120.md` S-8).
 *
 * Three things had shipped, been unit-tested against fake GL contexts, and never
 * been seen in a browser: the §47 `PerspectiveCamera`, the §68 lighting MVP
 * (`LitMaterial` + one `DirectionalLight` + scene ambient), and the §53 3D
 * primitives (`sphereGeometry`, `torusGeometry`, `capsuleGeometry`, R-19/R-20).
 * `examples/first-3d-scene` is the page that uses all three at once, and this
 * file measures it from the outside:
 *
 * ```text
 * page load → WebGL 2 context → PerspectiveCamera + DirectionalLight + ambient
 *   → LitProgram: color × (ambient + lightColor · max(N·−L, 0)) → pixels
 *                            ↑                         ↑
 *          §38 MotionComponent spins the torus    §15 Tween bobs the capsule
 * ```
 *
 * ## What is measured, and why each measurement is falsifiable
 *
 * | test | § | assertion |
 * | ---- | - | --------- |
 * | loads | §45, §61 | `#status` reaches `data-state="running"`, the drawing buffer is non-zero, the page's own account says perspective camera + 1 light + 5 meshes, and no console error or unhandled rejection is recorded |
 * | draws | §53, §57 | all four meshes reach the framebuffer in their own hue, and the lit ground is far brighter than the cleared background above the horizon |
 * | shades | §68 | each sphere's **upper-left** is several times brighter than its **lower-right**, and its dark side is still brighter than the background — Lambert diffuse plus a non-zero ambient term, neither of which a flat fill can imitate |
 * | perspective | §47 | the two spheres share a geometry *instance* and a material *instance*, so the only thing that can make the near one cover ~4× the pixels of the far one is the projection. **An orthographic camera scores exactly 1.0 here** |
 * | moves | §10, §38, §15 | two frames 300 ms apart differ over a large area, and the page's frame and simulated-time counters both advance |
 *
 * The perspective test is the one worth reading twice: it is not "the class is
 * named `PerspectiveCamera`" (the status attribute says that, and a string is
 * not evidence) but "objects farther away are smaller", measured in pixels.
 *
 * ## The seventh site
 *
 * `playwright.config.ts` runs one `vite preview` per built example;
 * `first-3d-scene` is the seventh, on port 4179. {@link SCENE_3D_URL} restates
 * that port for the reason the scene constants below are restated rather than
 * imported — see "Method notes". Run `pnpm examples:build` (or
 * `pnpm first-3d-scene:build`) before `pnpm test:browser`, or the preview server
 * has no `dist` to serve.
 *
 * ## Method notes
 *
 * The scene's numbers are **restated** from the example rather than imported,
 * for the reason every other spec here gives: a browser gate checks the built
 * page from the outside, and importing the example's constants would let a wrong
 * scene agree with a wrong expectation.
 *
 * The PNG decoder is a copy of `example.spec.ts`'s, as in every other spec here:
 * Playwright returns an encoded screenshot, comparing compressed bytes would
 * conflate "the picture changed" with "the encoder picked different filters",
 * the workspace pins no image library, and this packet's file scope forbids
 * editing a sibling spec to share one.
 *
 * Nothing here is a golden image: the gate runs on SwiftShader, whose
 * rasterisation differs from a GPU's, so every assertion is a measurement with a
 * stated margin (§92). Each threshold below quotes what the probe measured.
