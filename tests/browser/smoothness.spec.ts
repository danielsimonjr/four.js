/**
 * Phase 3 exit evidence: §106's "render **smoothly** despite fixed-step
 * simulation" (WP-3.9).
 *
 * The WP-3.8 gate proves the canvas is not blank and that *something* changes
 * between two frames. Neither answers §106's actual question, which is about
 * the *character* of the change: a render loop that stalls, that skips, or that
 * reads a stale simulation state also makes two frames differ. This suite
 * measures the motion instead of merely detecting it.
 *
 * ## What is measured
 *
 * `examples/first-2d-scene` orbits an orange circle around the world origin on
 * a `CircularTrajectory` — radius 2 world units, ω = π/2 rad/s, XY plane, phase
 * 0 (`examples/first-2d-scene/main.ts`). The camera is an `OrthographicCamera`
 * covering x ∈ [-4, 4], y ∈ [-3, 3], so canvas pixels map back to world units
 * by an affine transform with no perspective term. That makes the orbiter's
 * *world* position recoverable from a screenshot: find the orange pixels,
 * take their centroid, and un-project. A disc's projected centroid is its
 * centre, and the orbiter is never clipped by the viewport and never occluded
 * (the only other geometry is behind it or 3.2 world units away), so the
 * centroid is unbiased.
 *
 * Six equally spaced intervals are then checked for four properties, and a
 * fourth test (below) checks a fifth:
 *
 * 1. **Nothing stalls** — every consecutive frame pair differs in pixels.
 * 2. **The rate is right** — each interval's angular displacement matches
 *    ω × (elapsed wall-clock) to within a factor of {@link RATE_TOLERANCE}.
 *    Both directions matter: too large is a jump (a dropped or double-applied
 *    step), too small is a stutter or a partially stalled loop.
 * 3. **Nothing teleports or freezes** — the six displacements agree with each
 *    other to within {@link UNIFORMITY_TOLERANCE}. Equally spaced samples of a
 *    constant-rate path must sweep equal angles, and unlike (2) this comparison
 *    is unaffected by how long a screenshot takes.
 * 4. **Nothing reverses** — every interval sweeps the same way, and the
 *    centroid stays on the radius-2 circle, so the recovered path really is the
 *    trajectory the scene describes rather than an artefact of the detector.
 *
 * ## Interpolation, and why the last test injects a clock
 *
 * The three properties above would also hold for a renderer that drew the last
 * simulated pose and interpolated nothing — which is the half of §106 that
 * "despite fixed-step simulation" is actually about. Worse, it cannot be
 * observed here by default: this machine's frame rate *equals* the 60 Hz fixed
 * step, so the accumulator's leftover stays near zero and every drawn pose
 * coincides with a simulated one whether or not §43 is wired up.
 *
 * The fourth test therefore makes `requestAnimationFrame` report a virtual
 * clock ticking 1.5 fixed steps per frame — nothing else is stubbed — which
 * forces `interpolationAlpha` to alternate 0.5 and 0.0. The alpha-0.5 frames
 * must then put the orbiter exactly half a step past the last simulated pose,
 * a position the simulation never computes. That is the observable signature of
 * interpolated rendering, and no amount of unit testing over `PoseBuffer` can
 * establish that the assembled application, renderer and GL backend deliver it.
 *
 * The interpolation sampler is **frame-synchronised**, not wall-clock
 * synchronised. A time-spaced screenshot loop aliases against the two-frame
 * alpha cycle: if a consistently even number of virtual frames elapses between
 * captures, every sample lands on the same phase and `midStep` is 0 even
 * though §43 is working. After the clock is installed, the test waits for a
 * known number of rAF callbacks (1, 2, 3, … so both phases appear), freezes
 * the injected clock on that frame, and only then screenshots. None of this
 * resolves single-frame judder.
 *
 * ## Method notes
 *
 * Nothing here is a golden image. The gate runs on SwiftShader, whose
 * rasterisation differs from a GPU's, so every threshold is a measurement with
 * margin (§92).
 *
 * The PNG decoder is a copy of the one in `example.spec.ts`: Playwright returns
 * an encoded screenshot, comparing compressed bytes would conflate "the picture
 * changed" with "the encoder picked different filters", and neither spec may
 * edit the other under this packet's file scope. The workspace pins no image
 * library and a browser gate must not be the reason one is added.
