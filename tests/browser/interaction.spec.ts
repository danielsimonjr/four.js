/**
 * Phase 3a exit evidence: §106a's "pointer events, picking, dragging, sprites
 * and labels work in a mixed 2D/3D example" (WP-3a.6).
 *
 * The WP-3.8 gate proves the example draws and the WP-3.9 suite proves it moves
 * smoothly. Neither touches the page. This suite does: every assertion below is
 * driven by Playwright's **real** mouse — CDP-level input that Chromium turns
 * into the same `pointerdown`/`pointermove`/`pointerup` the canvas would get
 * from a hand — and read back out of the framebuffer. Nothing is stubbed,
 * nothing is dispatched from page script, and no engine object is reached into.
 * What is under test is the whole assembled path:
 *
 * ```text
 * Chromium input → canvas pointer event → PointerInput (NDC + Y flip)
 *   → pick (§71 camera ray vs. oriented bounds) → scene propagation (§72)
 *   → application listener (recolour / DragManager + §42 authority handover)
 *   → renderer → pixels
 * ```
 *
 * A unit test can check any one of those links. Only a browser can check that
 * the pixel a human aims at is the object the ray finds — the composition of
 * the CSS rectangle, the DPR, the NDC convention, the Y flip, the projection,
 * and the camera's world matrix. A single sign error anywhere in that chain
 * still passes every unit test in `@four/input` and puts the click in the wrong
 * quadrant, which is exactly the defect this file exists to catch.
 *
 * ## What is measured
 *
 * `examples/first-2d-scene/main.ts` (restated as constants below, never
 * imported — see "Method notes"):
 *
 * 1. **A click recolours the thing it lands on.** The tumbling box cycles a
 *    four-entry palette on `click`. Its colour is read as the mean of its own
 *    pixels, and must land on the *next* palette entry — not merely a different
 *    one, which would also be true if the event were delivered twice.
 * 2. **A click that hits nothing changes nothing.** Picking returning no hit
 *    dispatches no event at all (`PointerInput.#dispatch`), so a press on empty
 *    background must leave both shapes' colours alone. This is the half of
 *    propagation that a positive test cannot see: an over-eager fallback
 *    ("no hit → deliver to the root") passes test 1 and fails here.
 * 3. **A drag moves the box, and the box comes back.** The pointer is pressed
 *    on the box, walked across the canvas in eight steps, and released. The
 *    box's centroid must arrive at the world position the pointer walked to;
 *    the box must then resume tumbling (§42 handover back to `"kinematic"`),
 *    and must *stop* following the pointer (the capture was really released).
 * 4. **The label is legible.** The glyph sprites must put real ink in the label's
 *    world band, spread across most of the label's width — a text path that
 *    renders one glyph, or a row of missing-glyph boxes, fails the spread and
 *    the ink count respectively.
 * 5. **None of it logs an error.** Same collection as `example.spec.ts`, over a
 *    session that clicks, drags and releases.
 *
 * ## How a world position becomes a mouse position
 *
 * The camera is orthographic over x ∈ [-4, 4], y ∈ [-3, 3] and the canvas is
 * 800 × 600 CSS pixels, so the mapping either way is affine with no perspective
 * term. Two scales are in play and both are handled explicitly:
 *
 * - **Mouse coordinates are CSS pixels.** They are computed from the canvas's
 *   live `boundingBox()`, so the page's flex centring, the DPR and any future
 *   CSS size are all absorbed; nothing assumes 800 × 600 or an origin at 0, 0.
 * - **Screenshot coordinates are drawing-buffer pixels** — `renderer.resize(…,
 *   window.devicePixelRatio)` makes the buffer the CSS size times the DPR. Every
 *   measurement below therefore normalizes by `image.width`/`image.height`
 *   before un-projecting, so a run at DPR 1 and a run at DPR 2 produce the same
 *   world numbers. {@link expectMatchingAspect} pins the one assumption that
 *   remains: that the two rectangles describe the same view.
 *
 * ## Method notes
 *
 * Nothing here is a golden image. The gate runs on SwiftShader, whose
 * rasterisation and dithering differ from a GPU's, so every threshold is a
 * measurement with margin (§92) and every constant states where its number came
 * from.
 *
 * The scene's numbers are *restated* from the example rather than imported, for
 * the reason `smoothness.spec.ts` gives: a browser gate checks the built page
 * from the outside, and importing the example's constants would let a wrong
 * scene agree with a wrong expectation.
 *
 * The PNG decoder is a copy of `example.spec.ts`'s, as in `smoothness.spec.ts`:
 * Playwright returns an encoded screenshot, comparing compressed bytes would
 * conflate "the picture changed" with "the encoder picked different filters",
 * the workspace pins no image library, and this packet's file scope forbids
 * editing either sibling to share one.
