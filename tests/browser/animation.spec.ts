/**
 * Phase 4 exit evidence in a real browser: §107's authored animation — tweens,
 * a clip, and a timeline with a marker — reaching actual pixels (WP-4.8).
 *
 * `tests/determinism/phase4-animation.test.ts` proves the animation pillar is
 * deterministic; it proves nothing about whether any of it is *visible*. This
 * suite is the other half, and it is deliberately the same kind of gate as
 * `smoothness.spec.ts` and `interaction.spec.ts`: drive the built
 * `examples/first-2d-scene` in headless Chromium over SwiftShader, screenshot
 * it, and measure. Nothing is stubbed, no engine object is reached into, and
 * there are no golden images — every assertion is a threshold with a measured
 * provenance (§92).
 *
 * ## What is measured
 *
 * The example's "authored cluster" is two small shapes placed far out on either
 * side, each carrying §17 track value types (see that file's header):
 *
 * 1. **The diamond moves** — a `Tween` on its whole `transform.position`
 *    (§17 vector), `sine-in-out`, `yoyo`, forever. Measured as the y-centre of
 *    its pixel extent inside its own column of the frame.
 * 2. **The diamond's colour pulses** — a `Tween` on its material's RGBA
 *    (§17 colour) sequenced by the `Timeline`. Measured as the mean green
 *    channel of those same pixels, because green is the channel the two
 *    endpoint colours differ in most.
 * 3. **The vane turns and pops** — an `AnimationMixer` over a clip whose
 *    quaternion track is slerped (§17 quaternion), plus a `Timeline` tween on
 *    two components of its scale (§17 numeric). Measured as the vane's pixel
 *    count (scale) and its bounding-box aspect ratio (rotation — a *uniform*
 *    scale cannot change an aspect ratio, which is what separates the two).
 * 4. **The timeline's marker fires** — §16's discrete event, which steps the
 *    vane's material through a four-colour palette. Measured as plateaus in the
 *    vane's mean red channel over a window spanning at least two loops.
 * 5. **None of it disturbs the existing gates** — the WP-4.7 invariant, now a
 *    standing one: no pixel inside either cluster rectangle may satisfy
 *    `smoothness.spec.ts`'s orbiter classifier or `interaction.spec.ts`'s box
 *    classifier, whatever the animation is doing. Those two suites scan the
 *    *whole* frame for their shapes, so a cluster pixel that drifted into either
 *    gamut would silently corrupt a centroid three tests away.
 *
 * ## Sampling: one fixed sweep, no retries
 *
 * The page's animation phase at load is not controllable — the timeline starts
 * when the bundle runs — so an assertion about "two frames 0.6 s apart" would be
 * a lottery: the diamond's `sine-in-out` tween is momentarily stationary at each
 * turning point, and two samples straddling one can legitimately differ by 0.1
 * world units.
 *
 * The suite takes **one fixed sweep** of {@link SAMPLE_COUNT} screenshots
 * {@link SAMPLE_INTERVAL_SECONDS} apart in `beforeAll` and every test asserts
 * over that shared series — four separate sweeps would spend ~4× the
 * SwiftShader readback budget for the same animation window. There is no retry
 * loop, no polling for a condition, and no dependence on where in the loop the
 * page happened to be: the sweep is long enough ({@link SWEEP_MINIMUM_SECONDS})
 * to contain a full period of every animation in the cluster, so the *extremes*
 * it observes are the animation's extremes wherever it started. The reference
 * run took ~6.4 s of deliberate spacing for 16 samples at 0.4 s apart;
 * SwiftShader's screenshot cost dominates on Windows (~2.5 s per capture
 * measured), which is why {@link SAMPLE_COUNT} was reduced from 22 and why the
 * describe block runs serially with a single sweep.
 *
 * ## Method notes
 *
 * The scene's numbers are *restated* from the example rather than imported, for
 * the reason `smoothness.spec.ts` gives: a browser gate checks the built page
 * from the outside, and importing the example's constants would let a wrong
 * scene agree with a wrong expectation.
 *
 * The PNG decoder is a copy of `example.spec.ts`'s, as in `smoothness.spec.ts`
 * and `interaction.spec.ts`: Playwright returns an encoded screenshot, comparing
 * compressed bytes would conflate "the picture changed" with "the encoder picked
 * different filters", the workspace pins no image library, and this packet's
 * file scope forbids editing a sibling spec to share one.
 *
 * Every threshold below quotes the reference run measured by WP-4.8 on this
 * build, at 800 × 600 drawing-buffer pixels under `--use-angle=swiftshader`.
