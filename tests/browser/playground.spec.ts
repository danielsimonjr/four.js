/**
 * Phase 5 browser gate: §108's *"mixed 2D/3D demo in which gravity, collisions,
 * impulses and sensors all go through one common API"*, measured from outside
 * the page (plan WP-5.8).
 *
 * `tests/determinism/phase5-physics.test.ts` proves the two solvers are
 * deterministic; `tests/integration/physics-rapier.test.ts` proves the stable
 * API composes with them. Neither answers the question §108 actually asks,
 * which is whether the composed thing *works in a browser*: whether the wasm
 * loads, whether a fixed-step simulation driven by a real animation frame loop
 * makes bodies fall and settle, whether a sensor notices them, and whether a
 * click reaches a body through picking and comes back as an impulse. Those are
 * the four things this file measures, in `examples/physics-playground` —
 * §108's demonstration — through Chromium's real framebuffer and Playwright's
 * real mouse.
 *
 * ```text
 * page load → Rapier wasm init → PhysicsSystem (2 worlds, 2 adapters)
 *   → fixed-step accumulator → node transforms → WebglRenderer → pixels
 *                                    ↑
 *   Chromium mouse → PointerInput → pick → applyImpulseAtPoint (§26)
 * ```
 *
 * ## The second site
 *
 * This spec drives a **different** server from every other file in this
 * directory: `playwright.config.ts` runs one `vite preview` per built example,
 * `first-2d-scene` on 4173 (the suite's `baseURL`) and `physics-playground` on
 * 4174. {@link PLAYGROUND_URL} restates that port for the reason the scene
 * constants below are restated rather than imported — see "Method notes".
 * Run `pnpm playground:build` before `pnpm test:browser`, or the preview server
 * has no `dist` to serve.
 *
 * ## What is measured, and against what
 *
 * | test | §  | assertion |
 * | ---- | -- | --------- |
 * | loads | §108 | `#status` reaches `data-state="running"`, i.e. both wasm images decoded and the loop started |
 * | gravity + settle | §22, §23 | body pixels in **both** halves fall to a centroid of y ≈ −2.5 and then stop changing |
 * | sensors | §24, §29 | each zone's face repaints from its empty colour to its occupied colour, and `data-zone2d` / `data-zone3d` mirror the occupancy |
 * | impulse | §26, §71 | a real click on a located body sends it more than a world unit above everything that was on screen, and the half re-settles afterwards |
 *
 * Every threshold below states the number the reference run measured and how
 * much margin the threshold leaves. Nothing here is a golden image: the gate
 * runs on SwiftShader, whose rasterisation differs from a GPU's, so every
 * assertion is a measurement with margin (§92).
 *
 * ## Method notes
 *
 * The scene's numbers are **restated** from the example rather than imported,
 * for the reason `smoothness.spec.ts` and `interaction.spec.ts` give: a browser
 * gate checks the built page from the outside, and importing the example's
 * constants would let a wrong scene agree with a wrong expectation.
 *
 * The PNG decoder is a copy of `example.spec.ts`'s, as in `smoothness.spec.ts`
 * and `interaction.spec.ts`: Playwright returns an encoded screenshot,
 * comparing compressed bytes would conflate "the picture changed" with "the
 * encoder picked different filters", the workspace pins no image library, and
 * this packet's file scope forbids editing a sibling spec to share one.
 *
 * The one place this file is *not* a pure outside-in pixel measurement is the
 * two `data-zone*` attributes, which the example mirrors onto `#status` on
 * purpose. They are asserted **alongside** the pixel transition, never instead
 * of it: the attribute says the §29 event fired, the pixels say the event
 * reached the screen, and only both together say the sensor works.
