/**
 * Browser gate for the playground's **step-8 sensor bookkeeping** — the PH-21
 * follow-up (2026-08-29): §39's `PRIORITY_SENSOR_UPDATE` slot occupied by a
 * real system, between a real solve and real listeners, in a real browser.
 *
 * `packages/physics/tests/physics-event-system.test.ts` proves the split
 * dispatch mechanism; what nothing proved until this file is the *pattern* the
 * split exists for, running end to end in `examples/physics-playground`:
 *
 * ```text
 * 600  PhysicsSystem({ dispatchEvents: false })   both worlds step, events queue
 * 800  ZoneTallySystem                            overlapBox over each zone (§30)
 * 900  PhysicsEventSystem                         §29 triggers fire; the listeners
 *                                                 repaint from the step-8 tally
 * ```
 *
 * `playground.spec.ts` (untouched by this packet) keeps gating the observable
 * §29 behaviour — the empty→occupied repaint and the `data-zone*` counters —
 * which is itself the proof that the split *changed nothing the §29 contract
 * promises*. This file adds the two claims that are new:
 *
 * | test | § | assertion |
 * | ---- | -- | --------- |
 * | split + agreement | §30, §39 | the page runs the step-9 dispatch split (`data-dispatch="step-9"`), and once settled the step-8 query tally and the step-9 event counter tell the same story in both halves |
 *
 * ## Why "the same story" is a ±1 band, not equality
 *
 * The event counter is a delta accumulation over §29 transitions; the tally is
 * an absolute §30 re-measure of the same volume. The reference run (2026-08-29)
 * measured **3 = 3** in both halves at rest — exact agreement — but the
 * settled stack's top body rests with its underside mathematically *on* the
 * zone's top face (the example's drop layout puts it at exactly y = −1.6), and
 * a body touching a boundary is precisely where an intersection graph and an
 * overlap test may legitimately disagree by one. The assertion therefore
 * requires each count ≥ 1 and |tally − counter| ≤ 1: tight enough that a dead
 * tally system (0 vs 3) or an undrained event queue (3 vs 0) fails loudly,
 * loose enough that a borderline contact is not a flake.
 *
 * ## Method notes
 *
 * Attributes only, no pixels: the pixel evidence for the sensor pattern —
 * that the repaint reaches the screen — is `playground.spec.ts`'s existing
 * "each sensor zone repaints" test, which now exercises the tally-driven
 * repaint by construction (the listener's colour is `tally > 0`). Restating
 * that measurement here would gate the same pixels twice. The port is restated
 * from `playwright.config.ts` for the sibling specs' reason.
