/**
 * Browser gate for **§118's flagship demonstration**, `examples/flagship/
 * one-scene-everything-moves` (2026-08-07, `docs/AUDIT-120.md` S-8).
 *
 * §118 asks for one scene containing a rotating 3D cube, a 2D vector orbit, a
 * spring-connected pendulum, a bouncing rigid body, a world-space label, a
 * screen-space control panel, a timeline, a motorised hinge, collision events,
 * and pause / slow-motion / single-step controls — and states its success
 * criterion as a *feeling*: "it must feel like one motion-capable engine, not a
 * graphics library with physics bolted on afterward". A feeling cannot be
 * asserted, so this file measures the two things that produce it:
 *
 * 1. **Everything is in the same frame.** Each object owns a hue, and one
 *    screenshot is counted object by object. A page that drew the 3D scene but
 *    lost the 2D art, the particles or the text fails on a count, not on a
 *    class name.
 * 2. **Everything moves, on one clock, and the clock is controllable.** Pixels
 *    change while running; pause freezes them *exactly* (the measured number is
 *    zero); one single-step advances simulation time by exactly one
 *    `fixedDeltaTime` and changes the picture; the slider's slow motion changes
 *    the *rate* at which simulated time accumulates. All four are properties of
 *    §10's accumulator, not of any one system.

 *
 * ## What is measured, and why each measurement is falsifiable
 *
 * | test | § | assertion |
 * | ---- | - | --------- |
 * | loads | §45, §62, §37 | `#status` reaches `running`; the page reports the backend and solver the registries *chose* (`webgl2`, `rapier3d`) with no fallbacks; six bodies and two joints; no console error or unhandled rejection |
 * | one scene | §118 | six objects and two text layers are counted in **one** screenshot, each by its own hue, over a lit ground with a dark sky above it |
 * | everything moves | §10, §16, §29 | two frames 400 ms apart differ over a large area, simulated time advances, the §16 timeline reports laps, and §29 has reported landings |
 * | the panel is screen-space | §46, §47, §48, §71, §72 | the panel's own glyphs land in the lower-right quadrant of the second, `ScreenCamera` viewport, and pointing at each control the page publishes flips `data-hover` to that control's name |
 * | pause, single-step, overlay | §10, §113 | pause freezes the framebuffer (measured: **0** changed pixels) and simulated time; one step advances `sim` by exactly `1/60` s and redraws; the overlay's own colours appear where there were none |
 * | slow motion and the keyboard | §75, §9 | Tab reaches the slider, `Home` sets `timeScale` to its minimum, and simulated time then accumulates ~20× slower over the same wall-clock second; `Enter` activates the focused button and the activation reports `source: "keyboard"` |
 *
 * ## Method notes
 *
 * The scene's numbers are **restated** from the example rather than imported,
 * for the reason every other spec here gives: a browser gate checks the built
 * page from the outside, and importing the example's constants would let a
 * wrong scene agree with a wrong expectation.
 *
 * The **control positions are the exception, and are read from the page**
 * (`data-controls`). Recomputing where §74's flex layout puts a button would be
 * testing this file's copy of the layout algorithm rather than the engine's, so
 * the page publishes what it believes and this file checks that belief before
 * trusting it: it points at each published position and requires `data-hover`
 * to name that control. A page that published nonsense fails there.
 *
 * The PNG decoder is a copy of `example.spec.ts`'s, as in every other spec
 * here: Playwright returns an encoded screenshot, comparing compressed bytes
 * would conflate "the picture changed" with "the encoder picked different
 * filters", the workspace pins no image library, and a shared helper would mean
 * editing a sibling spec.
 *
 * Nothing here is a golden image: the gate runs on SwiftShader, whose
 * rasterisation differs from a GPU's, so every assertion is a measurement with
 * a stated margin (§92). Each threshold below quotes what the probe measured.
