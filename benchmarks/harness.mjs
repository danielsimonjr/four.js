/**
 * The shared benchmark runner (§92 performance tests, §86 targets; plan §6j,
 * P11-4, WP-11.4).
 *
 * ```sh
 * pnpm run build               # every script here imports the built dist
 * node benchmarks/harness.mjs  # prints the suite index and how to run it
 * ```
 *
 * `benchmarks/particles-100k.mjs` (WP-9.4) was the first script in this
 * directory and deliberately shipped without a framework — plan §6h's note that
 * *"a harness designed around one script is a harness designed around
 * nothing"*. Phase 11 has four more scripts to write, so the shape that script
 * arrived at is extracted here **unchanged in substance**: warm up, measure a
 * fixed number of iterations, reduce the durations to order statistics, stamp
 * the host, write one JSON record per benchmark, print a human report.
 *
 * This module is that extraction and nothing more. It adds no dependency, no
 * configuration file, no CLI framework, and no scheduling: a benchmark here is
 * still a plain `node` script that happens to import six small functions.
 *
 * ## What this harness is not
 *
 * **It is not a gate.** Nothing in CI asserts on a timing produced through it,
 * and {@link MEASUREMENT_NOTE} is written into every record so a reader who
 * finds one of these files out of context is told so on the first line. The
 * reasons are in `benchmarks/README.md`: CI containers are shared, have no GPU,
 * and vary run to run by tens of percent, so a wall-clock assertion would be a
 * flake generator that also happens to be dishonest about what it proves.
 *
 * **It is not a statistical package.** It reports mean, median, p95, p99, min
 * and max over the raw per-iteration durations, by nearest rank — every printed
 * number is a duration some iteration actually took, never an interpolation
 * between two of them. There is no outlier rejection: on a shared host the
 * outliers *are* the finding.
 *
 * ## Wall clocks: measurement, never simulation (plan §1 ground rule)
 *
 * `performance.now()` appears in {@link measure} and must appear nowhere else
 * in a benchmark. It is a **measurement instrument**: nothing it returns is fed
 * back into an engine call. Every script here drives simulation with a constant
 * injected delta (§10, §33) exactly as `Application`'s fixed-step accumulator
 * would, so deleting every timer from a benchmark must leave the simulated
 * result bit-identical. The ISO timestamp {@link hostRecord} does not carry —
 * `recordedAt` is written by each script from `new Date()` — dates the record
 * and likewise never enters a run.
 *
 * ## The two-file contract of a benchmark
 *
 * A script owns its scenario, its constants and its record's domain fields; the
 * harness owns the timing loop, the statistics, the host block and the writer.
 * A record is therefore `{ _note, benchmark, specification, recordedAt, …the
 * script's own fields…, ...hostRecord(), hostCaveat }` — the host block last,
 * because it is the part a reader must check before quoting anything above it.
