/**
 * The suite runner — every benchmark in `harness.mjs`'s `SUITE`, in order, each
 * in its own process, and one combined record (§86 targets, §92 performance
 * tests; A-27).
 *
 * ```sh
 * pnpm run build       # every script imports the built dist, not src
 * pnpm bench           # this file
 * pnpm bench ui-layout text-layout      # a subset, by record name or filename
 * pnpm bench --list                     # what would run, and in what order
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why a process each
 *
 * Every script here is a program with top-level side effects, its own warm-up
 * discipline and its own JIT profile. Importing them into one process would let
 * the first script's optimisation pay for the second's, let one script's heap
 * decide another's GC pauses, and let a `RangeError` in one delete the whole
 * run's records. A child process per script costs about 100 ms of Node start-up
 * and buys independence, which is the right trade for numbers that are read
 * against each other.
 *
 * Their stdio is **inherited**, so each script's own report prints as it runs.
 * The runner adds a summary at the end and takes nothing away.
 *
 * ## Still not a gate
 *
 * This runner asserts on **no timing whatsoever**, and adding one would be the
 * back door `benchmarks/README.md` forbids. Its exit code reports one thing: a
 * script that **failed** — a non-zero exit, which for these scripts means a
 * structural assertion tripped (a scene that did not resolve, a mixer that
 * stopped, a corpus that drew the wrong number of quads) or the build was not
 * run. A benchmark that got slower is a finding for a reader; a benchmark that
 * threw is a broken benchmark, and those are different things.
 *
 * ## The combined record
 *
 * `results/suite.json` is a **manifest, not a summary**: which scripts ran,
 * whether each succeeded, how long each took in wall-clock seconds, and the
 * `benchmark`/`recordedAt` of the record each one wrote. It deliberately copies
 * no measurement out of those records — one number in two files is one number
 * that can disagree with itself. To read a result, read its own record; to know
 * whether a whole suite ran on one host on one day, read this.
 *
 * `wallSeconds` is **not a measurement of the code under test**: it includes
 * Node start-up, module loading of the built `dist`, scenario construction, and
 * every warm-up. It is here so a reader knows what running the suite costs and
 * can see when one script's share changes.
