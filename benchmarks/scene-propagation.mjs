/**
 * World-transform propagation over deep and wide scene graphs (§7 resolution,
 * §7b; §92's *"CPU time"* metric; plan §6j P11-4, WP-11.4).
 *
 * ```sh
 * pnpm run build          # this script imports the built dist, not src
 * node benchmarks/scene-propagation.mjs
 * ```
 *
 * ## What is measured
 *
 * `resolveWorldTransforms(root)` is the single writer of every
 * `Transform.worldMatrix` (§7) and runs **twice per frame** in a rendering
 * application — once before physics synchronisation and once before render-item
 * generation. It is therefore the one scene-graph cost that scales with node
 * count no matter what the renderer or the solver is doing, which is what makes
 * it worth a benchmark of its own.
 *
 * Each scenario is measured in the **three states a real frame produces**,
 * because the resolver's whole design is that they cost wildly different
 * amounts and a single number would hide that:
 *
 * | pass | what is dirty | what the resolver must do |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `full` | the root | recompute **every** node — a `Matrix4` multiply each |
 * | `sparse` | {@link SPARSE_DIRTY_NODES} leaves | recompute exactly those leaves |
 * | `cached` | nothing | walk and compare versions; **zero** arithmetic |
 *
 * The `cached` row is the interesting one: §86's *"idle scene — near-zero
 * unnecessary uploads and simulation work"* is a claim about exactly this, and
 * the row measures what an idle frame actually costs per node. The script
 * asserts `recomputed === 0` on it, so the number is a measurement of the
 * caching working rather than of a coincidence.
 *
 * ## Scene shapes
 *
 * Four (see {@link SCENARIOS}): a flat 1 000-child root, a 10 000-node and a
 * 111 111-node ten-way tree, and a 2 000-deep chain. Depth and width are varied
 * separately because they stress different things — width is throughput,
 * depth is the dependency chain that forces a recompute to the leaves.
 *
 * ## An authoring-time finding about depth, recorded here
 *
 * `resolveWorldTransforms` walks the subtree by **recursion, one JS frame per
 * node of depth**, so maximum scene depth is bounded by the JS stack rather
 * than by memory. Probed once while writing this script (2026-08-02, node
 * v22.22.2, the host in this file's record, default stack): a **8 000-deep**
 * chain resolves; a **12 000-deep** chain throws `RangeError: Maximum call
 * stack size exceeded`. That is not measured on every run — it is a one-off
 * observation stated because it belongs next to these numbers — and the deep
 * scenario here is 2 000, comfortably inside it. Deep scenes are unusual and
 * nothing in the engine is documented as supporting unbounded depth, so this is
 * recorded as a finding, not treated as a defect by this packet.
 *
 * ## Wall clocks and §86
 *
 * No simulation runs here: the scenes are mutated by direct writes and by
 * `Transform.markDirty()`, never by a clock, and `performance.now()` lives in
 * `harness.mjs` where nothing under test can read it. §86 has **no
 * transform-propagation row**. The two rows it does have that are node-count
 * shaped — *"simple mesh instances: 100 000 visible instances where GPU-bound
 * limits permit"* and *"retained UI nodes: 5 000"* — are statements about
 * drawing and about UI, not about this pass; the 111 111-node scenario is sized
 * to the first of them so a reader can see what the scene-graph half of such a
 * scene costs, and that is the whole of the relationship. Recorded, never
 * gated.
