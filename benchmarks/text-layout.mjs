/**
 * Glyph layout throughput — the CPU half of §86's *"animated glyphs: 20 000"*
 * row (§56 text at its MVP tier; §92's *"CPU time"* metric).
 *
 * ```sh
 * pnpm run build          # this script imports the built dist, not src
 * node benchmarks/text-layout.mjs
 * ```
 *
 * ## Which half of the row this is, and which half stays blocked
 *
 * §86 asks for 20 000 animated glyphs. Getting 20 000 glyphs onto a screen is
 * two costs, and only one of them is CPU work `@four/text` does:
 *
 * 1. **Producing the quads** — `layoutText(string, atlas, options)` turning a
 *    string into one positioned, uv-mapped rectangle per drawn glyph. Pure
 *    arithmetic, no engine objects, no renderer, no DOM. That is this file.
 * 2. **Drawing them.** Blocked until 2026-08-13, and not on hardware: §56's
 *    bitmap tier shipped an atlas that could not be addressed per glyph, so the
 *    documented workaround (`examples/first-2d-scene`, `examples/ui-demo`) cut
 *    every glyph cell into its own `Texture` — a texture bind and a draw call
 *    per glyph. **R-29's §55 `frame` and R-28's `Text` node closed that**, and
 *    the second half of this script measures what replaced it: `Text` turns a
 *    layout into **one** indexed vertex buffer over **one** atlas material, so
 *    20 000 glyphs are one `drawElements` and the CPU cost is the buffer build.
 *
 * The *submission* of that draw is still GPU work a headless script cannot
 * measure, exactly as `render-batching.mjs` says of its own rows — so the row
 * moves from **feature**-blocked to **half**-measured in both halves' sense:
 * preparation measured, submission GPU-blocked.
 *
 * ## What "animated" costs, honestly
 *
 * A glyph that merely **moves** is laid out **once**: the quads are geometry,
 * and animating the node's transform never re-enters `layoutText`. Only text
 * whose **content** changes — a counter, a typewriter, a scrolling log, a
 * per-frame readout — pays this cost again. So the numbers here are the
 * **worst case** for §86's row, not its normal case, and reading them as the
 * price of 20 000 animated glyphs would overstate it. The row's normal case is
 * one layout at authoring time and 20 000 quads redrawn per frame, which is
 * cost (2) above.
 *
 * ## What is measured
 *
 * One iteration is **one `layoutText` call per string in the corpus** — a frame
 * in which every string's content changed. Corpora are sized by **total drawn
 * glyphs**, which is what §86 counts, not by characters: a space advances the
 * pen and emits no quad, so `quads.length` is below the character count and the
 * script asserts the exact expected value rather than assuming it.
 *
 * ## Attribution
 *
 * A total-glyph number cannot say whether a call or a glyph is the expensive
 * thing, so at {@link ATTRIBUTION_GLYPHS} glyphs the same work is re-measured
 * across four string lengths — {@link ATTRIBUTION_LENGTHS} — from 20 000
 * one-glyph calls to 100 two-hundred-glyph calls. Two of those rows solve
 * `total = calls · perCall + glyphs · perGlyph` exactly, and both terms are
 * recorded.
 *
 * A third term is visible from the source rather than from a clock:
 * `layoutText` **allocates and freezes one object per drawn glyph**, plus a
 * frozen array and a frozen result per call. At §86's 20 000 glyphs that is
 * 20 000 `Object.freeze` calls per frame. Its share is bounded by a **control
 * row** — {@link ATTRIBUTION_GLYPHS} plain object literals of the same eight
 * numeric fields, created and frozen in this file, touching no engine code at
 * all. It is labelled a control because that is what it is: a measurement of
 * the platform primitive, published so the per-glyph figure above it can be
 * read, and not a measurement of `@four/text`.
 *
 * ## Determinism and wall clocks
 *
 * The corpus is generated from {@link SEED} through a small LCG, so two runs
 * lay out identical strings (§33). `layoutText` is pure — same string, same
 * atlas, same options, identical numbers — which the script asserts by
 * comparing a probe quad across the whole run. No clock reaches it;
 * `performance.now()` lives in `harness.mjs`.
 *
 * Recorded, never gated — see `benchmarks/README.md`.
