/**
 * §64's per-view render lists and §87's frustum cull — what a viewport costs
 * (R-8, 2026-08-09; §92's *"CPU time"* and *"draw calls"* metrics).
 *
 * ```sh
 * pnpm run build          # this script imports the built dist, not src
 * node benchmarks/view-culling.mjs
 * ```
 *
 * ## The question this exists to answer
 *
 * R-8 had two shapes to choose between, and the choice is the packet's main
 * design decision:
 *
 * - **derive** — traverse the scene **once** into the frame's list, then filter
 *   that list into a per-view list for each viewport (what shipped);
 * - **rebuild** — call `buildRenderList(root, list, mask)` once **per view**
 *   (the rejected alternative).
 *
 * The argument for deriving was partly structural — traversal has side effects
 * (a particle system repacks its instances, a sprite rebuilds its quad), and
 * §69's shadow map is frame state that must not be filtered by any one view —
 * and partly a cost claim: `render-batching.mjs` measures list construction at
 * roughly 40% of a 100 000-sprite frame's preparation, and multiplying that by
 * the viewport count to answer a question that differs between viewports by a
 * bitmask and six planes is the wrong trade. This script measures the cost
 * claim rather than asserting it, at one, two and four views.
 *
 * ## What one iteration is
 *
 * One iteration is **one frame's list work** for `views` viewports:
 *
 * ```text
 * derive:   resolveWorldTransforms + buildRenderList + views × buildViewRenderList
 * rebuild:  resolveWorldTransforms + views × buildRenderList
 * ```
 *
 * Both arms end with the same per-view lists, so the difference is exactly the
 * design choice. Neither arm draws anything: submission needs a GPU, which a
 * headless CI container does not have, so — like `render-batching.mjs` — this
 * measures preparation only.
 *
 * A third arm measures the derivation **without** a frustum, so a reader can
 * separate §46's layer filter (one bitwise AND per item) from §87's cull (a
 * bounding sphere and up to six plane tests per item).
 *
 * ## What the draw-call number means
 *
 * `drawCallsCulled` is how many items survive into one view, and
 * `drawCallsUnculled` how many the same view drew before this packet: the scene
 * is authored so that a fixed fraction is off screen, which is what makes the
 * ratio a statement about culling rather than about the scene's size.
 *
 * ## Determinism and wall clocks
 *
 * The scene is authored from {@link SEED} through a small LCG, so two runs
 * build the identical graph (§33); no clock reaches the engine. `measure` from
 * `harness.mjs` owns the only `performance.now()`.
 *
 * Recorded, never gated — see `benchmarks/README.md`.
