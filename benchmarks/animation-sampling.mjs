/**
 * `AnimationMixer` sampling cost — a multi-track clip evaluated on N instances
 * per fixed step (§17 tracks, §16, §42; §92's *"CPU time"* metric; plan §6j
 * P11-4, WP-11.4).
 *
 * ```sh
 * pnpm run build          # this script imports the built dist, not src
 * node benchmarks/animation-sampling.mjs
 * ```
 *
 * ## What is measured
 *
 * One measured iteration is **`mixer.advance(fixedDeltaTime)` on every one of N
 * mixers** — the work `AnimationSystem` does once per frame. Per mixer that is:
 * advance the clip clock, resolve the loop iteration, sample every track at the
 * new clip-local time (§17 interpolation), check §42 authority once, and write
 * each sampled value through its binding into the node's `Transform`.
 *
 * The mixers are advanced directly rather than through `AnimationSystem`,
 * because the system's own per-frame work is a fixed cost over the list and
 * this benchmark is about what one animated object costs. The delta is the
 * constant {@link FIXED_DELTA_TIME}.
 *
 * ## The clip
 *
 * Four tracks, all bound into the node's own `Transform`, eight keys each over
 * {@link CLIP_DURATION_SECONDS} seconds, `linear` interpolation:
 * `transform.position`, `transform.rotation` (whose linear mode *is* slerp),
 * `transform.scale` and `transform.pivot`. Four is a plausible authored clip
 * for a moving prop, and keeping every track on the transform means the §42
 * authority gate is exercised on every instance on every step, which is part of
 * the real cost and is not something to measure with the gate switched off.
 *
 * Every node's `transformAuthority` is therefore `"animation"`. With the
 * default `"manual"` the mixer would refuse the writes and warn (§42), so the
 * benchmark would measure a refusal path N times per step and print a wall of
 * warnings — worth stating, because it is exactly the kind of detail that
 * quietly turns a benchmark into fiction.
 *
 * Clips and tracks are **immutable data and shared by every instance** (§17):
 * one clip object, N mixers. That is how an application animates a crowd, and
 * it means the numbers here are sampling and binding cost, not authoring cost.
 *
 * ## The attribution run
 *
 * The headline number alone cannot say whether a mixer is expensive or whether
 * *four tracks* are, so at {@link ATTRIBUTION_INSTANCES} instances the same
 * measurement is repeated with 1, 2 and 4 tracks. The 1-track figure is a
 * mixer's fixed per-step overhead plus one track; the slope between them is the
 * marginal cost of a track. Both are recorded; neither is acted on here.
 *
 * ## Wall clocks and §86
 *
 * No clock reaches the animation: `advance` is handed the constant
 * {@link FIXED_DELTA_TIME}, and `performance.now()` lives in `harness.mjs`.
 * Deleting every timer leaves the final poses bit-identical.
 *
 * §86 has **no mixer row**. Its nearest entry, *"animated glyphs: 20 000"*, is
 * about text rendering rather than about clip evaluation — a glyph is not a
 * mixer and 20 000 animated glyphs are usually one animated node. The 20 000
 * instance count here is chosen to sit at that same order of magnitude so the
 * two can be read side by side, and that is the whole of the relationship.
 * Recorded, never gated.
