/**
 * `@four/math` operation throughput and per-operation allocation (§7b, §83;
 * §92's *"CPU time … allocations"* metrics; plan §6j P11-4, WP-11.4).
 *
 * ```sh
 * pnpm run build          # this script imports the built dist, not src
 * node benchmarks/math-ops.mjs
 * ```
 *
 * ## What is measured, and why these two numbers together
 *
 * §7b makes two claims about the math types, and this script measures one and
 * checks the other on the same run:
 *
 * 1. **They are fast enough to be called per node per frame.** The reported
 *    figure per operation is **nanoseconds per operation**, derived from the
 *    measured milliseconds per batch of {@link OPERATIONS_PER_BATCH}.
 * 2. **They do not allocate in steady state.** `@four/math`'s own
 *    `constructionCount()` (§83's allocation instrumentation — every math
 *    constructor reports itself) is read across one extra batch per operation,
 *    so `allocationsPerOperation` is a *measured* zero rather than a claimed
 *    one. A non-zero entry here is a real defect in the hot path, not a
 *    performance opinion, and is the one thing in this file worth acting on
 *    immediately.
 *
 * The second number is why this script exists at all: a throughput figure on a
 * shared CI container is weak evidence, but "these operations allocated exactly
 * nothing across a million calls each" is a strong, host-independent statement
 * and is exactly the §92 *allocations* metric.
 *
 * ## Three deliberate defences against measuring nothing
 *
 * A micro-benchmark's characteristic failure is that the optimiser removes the
 * work and the script reports a beautiful number for an empty loop. Three
 * things here exist only to prevent that, and a reader should check all three
 * before believing any row:
 *
 * 1. **Varying operands.** Every operation reads its inputs from
 *    {@link VARIANTS}-long arrays indexed by the iteration counter, so no call
 *    is loop-invariant and none can be hoisted out. An earlier draft of this
 *    script used fixed operands and reported `Vector3.copy` at 3.6 ns against
 *    `Vector3.add` at 51 ns — the copy loop had been hoisted to a single store.
 *    That draft is why this paragraph exists.
 * 2. **The `baseline` row.** It performs the array indexing and the result read
 *    and *no math operation at all*. It is the floor: an operation row that
 *    lands at the baseline is not a fast operation, it is a deleted one.
 * 3. **`keepAlive`.** Each batch folds one scalar of its result through the
 *    harness's cross-module accumulator, printed at the end, so the results are
 *    observed and the calls cannot be dropped as dead.
 *
 * ## The `copy(...)` reset, stated rather than hidden
 *
 * The math types mutate in place (§7b) — `a.add(b)` writes into `a`. Measuring
 * a mutating operation in a loop therefore has to reset the receiver, or it
 * measures a drifting receiver instead (denormals, collapsing cross products,
 * quaternions leaving the unit sphere). This script resets with
 * `out.copy(src)`, and **measures `copy` itself as its own row** so the
 * overhead can be subtracted rather than trusted. The `includesCopyReset`
 * field of each row says which rows carry it; the operations that take an
 * explicit `out` parameter (`Quaternion.rotateVector3`, `Matrix4.compose`,
 * `Matrix4.decompose`) and the pure query `Vector3.dot` need no reset and carry
 * none.
 *
 * So, per row: `operation alone ≈ row − same-type copy row` for a prefixed row,
 * and `≈ row − baseline` for an unprefixed one. Both subtractions are noisy on
 * a shared host; they are stated as attribution, not as precision.
 *
 * ## Wall clocks and §86
 *
 * There is no simulation here at all — no clock, no delta, no state that
 * advances — so the plan §1 ground rule is satisfied trivially: `performance
 * .now()` lives in `harness.mjs`'s `measure` and nothing it returns is read by
 * anything under test. §86 has **no row for math-operation throughput**; this
 * script measures the foundation those rows all sit on and claims nothing about
 * them. Recorded, never gated.
