/**
 * Retained-UI layout cost — §86's *"retained UI nodes: 5 000"* row, measured on
 * the half of it that is CPU work (§73 widgets, §74 layout, §56 text
 * measurement; §92's *"CPU time"* metric).
 *
 * ```sh
 * pnpm run build          # this script imports the built dist, not src
 * node benchmarks/ui-layout.mjs
 * ```
 *
 * ## Which half of the row this is, and which half it is not
 *
 * §86 asks for 5 000 retained UI nodes. A frame of that costs two things:
 * **laying the tree out** and **drawing it**. `@four/ui`'s frozen dependency
 * matrix gives it `core`, `math`, `scene`, `input` and `text` and no renderer —
 * widgets own hierarchy, size, hit area and state, and the application supplies
 * every pixel through a `WidgetSkin` — so the two halves are separable in the
 * engine, not merely in this file.
 *
 * This script measures the first half only: `root.layout()` over a retained
 * tree of N widgets, which is the whole of what `@four/ui` does per frame. The
 * drawing half is not measured here and is not measurable headless: the shipped
 * skin path turns each glyph cell into its own `Texture` (§55's `frame`
 * sub-rectangle has not landed) and issues a draw call per quad, so a headless
 * number for it would be a number about a workaround. Until 2026-08-08
 * `benchmarks/README.md` filed this whole row under *"hardware"* on that
 * reasoning; the reasoning holds for the draw and never held for the layout,
 * which is why this file exists.
 *
 * ## What is measured
 *
 * One iteration is **`root.layout()`** — §74's two passes over the whole tree:
 * a bottom-up `measure()` (each `Label` measuring its text through
 * `@four/text`, each `Panel` the extent of its children) and a top-down
 * `arrange()` that writes every widget's position into its `Transform`.
 *
 * There is **no dirty tracking in §74's layout**: `layout()` always measures
 * and always arranges, whatever changed. The one memo in the pass is
 * `Label.textLayout`, invalidated by a write to `text`, `atlas`, `size` or
 * `letterSpacing`. So the three passes below are the three states a real
 * application's frame can be in, and their spread is that memo's whole effect:
 *
 * | pass          | invalidated before the pass         | what it stands for                      |
 * | ------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
 * | `cold`        | every `Label`                       | first frame, or a re-themed UI          |
 * | `incremental` | {@link INCREMENTAL_LABELS} `Label`s | a normal frame — a few captions changed |
 * | `warm`        | nothing                             | a frame where only layout inputs moved  |
 *
 * `cold − warm` is therefore the text-measurement share of a layout, and `warm`
 * alone is the cost of the walk §74 cannot avoid. Invalidation happens in the
 * harness's **untimed** `prepare` hook, so no measured duration includes the
 * property writes that caused it.
 *
 * The `cold` pass alternates each label between two strings of **equal glyph
 * count**, so the cache is genuinely invalidated while every resolved size in
 * the tree stays identical — the pass is more expensive, not differently
 * shaped, which is what lets the probe assertion below hold across all three.
 *
 * ## The state row
 *
 * A retained UI also pays for **state**: values change, controls enable and
 * disable, and each write dispatches §6b's `uivaluechange` / `uistatechange`.
 * At {@link ATTRIBUTION_WIDGETS} widgets that churn is measured separately
 * (`stateChurn…`) with **no listeners attached**, so the number is the setter
 * and the dispatch and not an application's handlers. It is reported next to
 * the layout numbers because the interesting fact is the ratio between them,
 * and it is deliberately not folded into them.
 *
 * ## Determinism and wall clocks
 *
 * The tree, the label strings and the churned values all come from {@link SEED}
 * through a small LCG, so two runs build the identical UI (§33). No clock
 * reaches `@four/ui`: `performance.now()` lives in `harness.mjs`, `layout()`
 * takes no time argument at all, and deleting every timer would leave every
 * resolved position bit-identical.
 *
 * Recorded, never gated — see `benchmarks/README.md`.
