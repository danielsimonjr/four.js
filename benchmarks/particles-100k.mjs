/**
 * §112's 100 000-particle CPU budget, measured (plan §6h, WP-9.4).
 *
 * ```sh
 * pnpm run build           # this script imports the built dist, not src
 * node benchmarks/particles-100k.mjs
 * ```
 *
 * §112 closes Phase 9 on *"≥100,000 simple particles simulated and rendered at
 * interactive rates on suitable hardware"*. Plan §6h reads that honestly for
 * this environment and splits it in two: the **renderer** must draw a system in
 * one draw call (`@four/render-webgl`'s instanced particle path, WP-9.3), and
 * the **CPU simulation** must step 100 000 particles inside a fixed-step budget
 * *measured and documented in a benchmark* — recorded numbers, deliberately not
 * gated on wall time in CI. This file is that benchmark. It was the first real
 * script in `benchmarks/` and was deliberately written without a framework.
 *
 * **WP-11.4 (plan §6j, P11-4) moved its plumbing into `./harness.mjs`** — the
 * timing loop, the order statistics, the host block, the results writer and the
 * report printer, all extracted from this file and now shared with the other
 * four scripts in the suite. Nothing about what is measured changed, and the
 * record's fields and their order are unchanged; only the run-to-run values
 * move, as they always do. The measurement code that used to live here is the
 * harness's, verbatim: the same nearest-rank quantiles, the same warm-up
 * accounting, the same two-space JSON.
 *
 * ## What is measured
 *
 * **The headline run**: one `ParticleEmitter` at capacity —
 * {@link PARTICLE_COUNT} live particles, none spawning, none dying — stepped
 * {@link MEASURED_STEPS} times under the §27 field stack the packet names:
 * **uniform gravity, linear drag, and a vortex**. Every step does the full
 * per-particle job: three field samples, an acceleration sum in the pinned
 * order, a semi-implicit Euler integration, an age update and a death test,
 * over 100 000 particles.
 *
 * The reported figure is **milliseconds per fixed step**, mean and p95, against
 * the 16.667 ms a 60 Hz fixed step has to spend (Appendix A's `fixedTimeStep`).
 * Mean says whether it fits; p95 says whether it fits *reliably*, which is what
 * "interactive rates" actually asks — a mean inside budget with a fat tail
 * still drops frames.
 *
 * **The attribution run** then repeats the same pool with 0, 1 and 2 fields, in
 * shorter bursts, because the headline number alone is uninterpretable. On the
 * recorded host the integrator itself costs about **1 ms per 100 000
 * particles** and each §27 field adds about **5–6 ms** — the fields, not the
 * integration, are the whole cost, and they are the cost of a virtual
 * `sample()` call per particle per field across a polymorphic call site
 * (`emitter.ts`'s field loop). That is a real finding about the current design
 * and is exactly what a benchmark is for; suppressing it and printing one
 * number would leave a reader guessing whether "particles are slow" means the
 * simulation or the extension seam. §27 field batching (sampling a whole lane
 * per call, or specialising the common built-ins) is the obvious follow-up and
 * is **not** in this packet's scope.
 *
 * ## Wall clocks: measurement, never simulation (ground rule)
 *
 * `performance.now()` now lives in `./harness.mjs` and nowhere near a
 * simulation. It is a **measurement instrument**: nothing it returns is fed
 * back into the engine, and the simulation is driven by a constant injected
 * {@link FIXED_DELTA_TIME}, exactly as `Application`'s fixed-step accumulator
 * would (§10, §33). Remove every timer and the steps produce the identical
 * pool. The same applies to the ISO timestamp written into the result file — it
 * dates the record, it does not enter the run.
 *
 * Determinism is likewise not what this file tests;
 * `tests/determinism/phase9-particles.test.ts` does that. Here the seed is
 * fixed only so that two runs measure the same work.
 *
 * ## Hardware caveat — read before quoting any number from this file
 *
 * The numbers this script prints describe **the machine it ran on**, and the
 * machine that produced the committed `results/particles-100k.json` is a **CI
 * container with no GPU**, sharing a host with other work. That matters twice
 * over:
 *
 * - **It is not "suitable hardware".** §112's phrase is a claim about a target
 *   machine; plan §6h's interpretation is what this benchmark can honestly
 *   answer, namely "here is the measured cost, on the record, on this box". A
 *   slower result here is not a failed §112 and a faster one is not a passed
 *   one. Nothing in CI asserts on these timings, and the run-to-run spread on a
 *   shared host is large (a first cold run measured a 24.6 ms mean where two
 *   later runs measured 17.5 and 17.4 — the same code, the same seed).
 * - **It measures the CPU half only.** No GL context is created, nothing is
 *   uploaded, nothing is drawn. The rendering half of §112 is WP-9.3's single
 *   instanced draw call, pinned structurally by the render and backend suites
 *   and exercised visibly — at a size SwiftShader can sustain — by
 *   `examples/particles-demo` and `tests/browser/particles.spec.ts`.
 *
 * Every run rewrites `results/particles-100k.json`, which is **committed** (it
 * is not covered by `.gitignore`). That is deliberate: plan §6h asks for
 * recorded numbers, so the file is a dated record and `git diff` after a run is
 * the honest way to see what changed. Re-running it on a different machine and
 * committing the result silently would be the dishonest use — note the host
 * fields the file carries.
