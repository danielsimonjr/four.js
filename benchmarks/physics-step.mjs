/**
 * §86's *"active rigid bodies: 5 000 simple bodies baseline"* row, measured
 * headlessly through the Rapier 3D adapter (§20–32, §37; §92's *"simulation
 * time … contacts"* metrics; plan §6j P11-4, WP-11.4).
 *
 * ```sh
 * pnpm run build          # this script imports the built dist, not src
 * node benchmarks/physics-step.mjs
 * ```
 *
 * ## The §86 row this speaks to, and exactly how far it goes
 *
 * §86 targets *"5 000 simple bodies baseline"* of **active** rigid bodies on
 * *"suitable modern desktop hardware"*. Two words in that sentence decide what
 * this script had to do:
 *
 * - **active.** §32 sleeping is enabled by default (Appendix A), and a settled
 *   pile of boxes goes to sleep within a second — after which "5 000 bodies"
 *   costs almost nothing and the number would be a lie by omission. So every
 *   scenario here runs with `sleeping: { enabled: false }`: all N bodies are
 *   awake and solved on every step, for the whole run. This is the *expensive*
 *   reading of §86's row and the only honest one.
 * - **suitable modern desktop hardware.** The recorded host is a shared CI
 *   container with no GPU. As in `particles-100k.mjs` (plan §6h), a slower
 *   result here is not a failed §86 and a faster one is not a passed one.
 *   Nothing in CI asserts on these timings.
 *
 * ## What one measured iteration is
 *
 * `PhysicsWorld.step(fixedDeltaTime)` — §39's steps 1–6: command drain,
 * kinematic feed, scene→solver sync, the solver step itself, solver→scene sync,
 * and the write-back of every body's pose and velocity into its node. That is
 * the whole per-fixed-step cost of the physics pillar for the scenario, and it
 * is measured against the **16.667 ms** a 60 Hz fixed step has to spend
 * (Appendix A's `fixedTimeStep`).
 *
 * §39 step 9 — `dispatchEvents()` — is run as the harness's **untimed
 * `prepare`** hook immediately before the next step instead. The world has no
 * listeners registered, so nothing observes the reordering; it exists so the
 * timed region is exactly the solve, and so the event queue cannot grow across
 * a run and turn the benchmark into a memory experiment. The events are still
 * counted before they are drained, and reported as `eventsPerStep` — §92's
 * *contacts* metric in the form this API actually exposes (§29
 * `collisionstart`/`collisionend`, not raw contact manifolds).
 *
 * ## The scenario
 *
 * One static floor and N dynamic unit boxes on a lattice above it, dropped and
 * left to pile up. Boxes rather than spheres because box-box contact manifolds
 * are the realistic case; a lattice rather than a random cloud because §33
 * forbids an RNG here and because a reader can reproduce a lattice exactly. The
 * warm-up steps are the pile landing; the measured steps are a resting-but-
 * awake pile, which is the steady state §86's row describes.
 *
 * `finalChecksum` is `world.checksum()` (§33) after the last step: it is not a
 * timing, it is the scenario's fingerprint, so a future run whose numbers moved
 * can be told apart from a future run whose *scene* moved.
 *
 * ## The attribution run
 *
 * A single "N bodies cost X ms" number is uninterpretable, exactly as plan §6h
 * found for particles. So every body count is measured **twice**: once as the
 * pile above, and once in **free fall** — the same N bodies on the same
 * lattice, with no floor, so they never touch, produce no contacts and queue no
 * §29 events. The difference is the whole cost of contact generation, contact
 * solving, and event translation; the free-fall figure is broad phase,
 * integration, and the per-body scene write-back alone.
 *
 * Both halves are worth having. The free-fall column says what N bodies cost
 * when nothing is happening — which is what a scene of independently moving
 * props actually is — and the difference says what a pile costs, which is what
 * a stress test actually is. Quoting either one as "the" cost of N bodies would
 * be a choice disguised as a measurement.
 *
 * ## Wall clocks (plan §1 ground rule)
 *
 * The simulation is driven by the constant {@link FIXED_DELTA_TIME} and by
 * nothing else. `performance.now()` lives in `harness.mjs` and nothing it
 * returns reaches the world; `PhysicsWorld.step` itself reads no clock (§33).
 * Delete every timer and the run produces the identical `finalChecksum`.
 *
 * ## What is *not* measured
 *
 * The 2D adapter (`Rapier2dAdapter`), joints (§28), queries (§30), and the
 * §19 blending pipeline. Each is its own cost with its own shape, and this
 * script is scoped to the one §86 row it can name. Recorded, never gated.
