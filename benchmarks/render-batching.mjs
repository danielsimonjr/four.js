/**
 * §65 batching throughput — the CPU half of §86's *"batched sprites: 100 000 at
 * 60 FPS"* and *"simple batched shapes: 50 000 at 60 FPS"* rows (R-9,
 * 2026-08-09; §64 stages 4–6, §92's *"CPU time"* and *"draw calls"* metrics).
 *
 * ```sh
 * pnpm run build          # this script imports the built dist, not src
 * node benchmarks/render-batching.mjs
 * ```
 *
 * ## Which half of the rows this is, and which half it is not
 *
 * Both rows are a *rate*: N sprites, or N shapes, at 60 FPS. A frame of that
 * costs two things — **preparing the draws** and **issuing them**. This script
 * measures the first half only, which is exactly what `@four/render` does per
 * frame and is pure CPU work:
 *
 * ```text
 * buildRenderList(scene, list)      §64 stages 1–2 and 4–5
 * batcher.next(list, i)             §64 stage 6 — plan the run, bake its vertices
 * ```
 *
 * The second half is `bufferSubData` + `drawElements` against a driver, and a
 * headless container has no GPU to issue them to. Until this script existed
 * `benchmarks/README.md` filed both rows under **feature** — "there is no sprite
 * batching", "there is no shape system to batch" — and both statements are now
 * out of date; they become **half** rows, joining `ui-layout.mjs` and
 * `text-layout.mjs` in the category A-27 opened for exactly this shape of
 * result.
 *
 * ## What one iteration is
 *
 * One iteration is **one frame's preparation**: `resolveWorldTransforms`, then
 * `buildRenderList` into a reused array, then a left-to-right pass calling
 * `RenderBatcher.next` and skipping the items each batch consumes. That pass
 * writes every merged vertex — the world transform of each item baked into a
 * `Float32Array` — so the number below includes the whole cost a backend would
 * hand to `bufferSubData`, not just the decision to batch.
 *
 * A second scenario per row measures `buildRenderList` **alone**, with no
 * batcher, so a reader can separate the list from the batching. It is not a
 * measurement of the unbatched *frame*: the per-item uniform uploads and draw
 * calls that frame would issue are backend work this script cannot see.
 *
 * ## What the draw-call numbers mean
 *
 * `drawCallsUnbatched` is the number of draw calls the WebGL 2 backend issues
 * for the scene today with no batcher assigned — one per render item, which is
 * a fact about `webgl-renderer.ts`'s loop and needs no GPU to count.
 * `drawCallsBatched` is what the same scene costs with one: one call per batch
 * the planner produced. Their ratio is the whole point of §65 and is the one
 * number here that is not a timing.
 *
 * ## Determinism and wall clocks
 *
 * The scenes are authored from {@link SEED} through a small LCG, so two runs
 * build the identical graph (§33); no clock reaches the engine. `measure` from
 * `harness.mjs` owns the only `performance.now()`, and deleting it would leave
 * every vertex this script produces bit-identical.
 *
 * Recorded, never gated — see `benchmarks/README.md`.
