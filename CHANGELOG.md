# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Once packages
are published, releases will follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) per §90 of the
specification; until then, entries are grouped by date under **Unreleased**.

## [Unreleased]

### 2026-07-29

#### Added
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — Phase 0 deliverable (§103), written for subagent-driven
  execution: work packets `WP-N.M` with mechanical Done-checks and [H]aiku/[S]tronger model
  tiers; §1 ground rules distilled from the spec's conventions (§6a/§6b/§7a/§7b, §33, §42);
  Phase 0 (11 packets) and Phases 1–2 (19 packets) fully decomposed; Phases 3–10 held at
  milestone level for rolling-wave decomposition; verification stack table (build/test/
  lint/check-spec/size/determinism). Directory tree verified complete against §98 — no new
  directories needed.

#### Changed (spec revision 1.3)
- `docs/SPECIFICATION.md` bumped to **revision 1.3** after a two-lens adversarial
  verification pass over the 1.1 material (16 unique findings, all fixed): world matrices
  resolve per fixed step, not per frame (§7); pause semantics defined (§10); the replay
  format now records per-frame step counts and dropped time, and §10 cites §34 rather than
  §113; §39 sensor update moved before collision-event dispatch (§6b now step 9);
  previous-pose capture for interpolation defined in §37; collider density authoritative
  over material density (§25); checksum visits existing bodies (incl. sleeping) in monotonic
  body-id order (§33); local-plane→XY mapping stated (§21); marker behavior under
  replay/snapshot-restore defined (§16); reduced motion added to §14; §40 unit options
  restricted to display/authoring conversion; `ForceField.sample` gains `out` (§27); §97
  field of view converted to radians; cameras/viewports assigned to `@four/scene` (§98,
  package README updated); Part VII group renamed "Renderables and 2D Vector Graphics";
  §6 audio marked plugin-provided.

#### Added
- `tools/check-spec.mjs` — mechanical consistency checker for `docs/SPECIFICATION.md`
  (section sequence with frozen 1–120 numbering, duplicates, fence balance, TOC/body
  agreement, §-reference validity, banned pre-revision terms). Intended as the docs job of
  the future Phase 0 CI workflow.
- Phase 0 toolchain decisions recorded in `MEMORY.md` (proposed at owner direction,
  overridable): Turborepo; evergreen browsers + Safari ≥ 16.4, WebGL 2 required, Node ≥ 20;
  Rapier via `@dimforge/rapier2d`/`rapier3d` wasm loaded in `initialize()`, version pinned at
  Phase 5, excluded from the §86 payload budget; size-limit CI gate as a Phase 0
  deliverable; TypeDoc for API docs.

#### Changed
- Scaffold docs synced to specification revision 1.2: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`,
  `docs/ERRATA.md` (scope note — amendments live in the spec's table; the archived PDF is
  formally frozen at the pre-1.0 text), `website/README.md`, and the `core`/`motion`/
  `physics`/`geometry` package READMEs (transform authority incl. `blended`, seconds
  convention, Y-up in both dimensions, component model, revised adapter contract, camera
  rigs in `@four/motion`, unit system in `@four/core`, tessellation as a geometry module).
  Also fixed a pre-existing AGENTS.md error (phase order is Part IX, not VIII).
- `docs/SPECIFICATION.md` bumped to **revision 1.2**: the §86 payload budget (minimal 2D
  application ≤ 150 kB gzip) was confirmed by the owner and its provisional marker removed;
  amendments table updated. `docs/SPEC-REVIEW.md` disposition note updated to match.

### 2026-07-28

#### Added
- `docs/SPEC-REVIEW.md` — technical review of `SPECIFICATION.md` proposing improvements
  R-1…R-35 (contradictions, underspecified designs, missing topics, structure), with a
  suggested disposition order keyed to the implementation phases. Proposals only; the
  specification itself is unchanged.
- `AGENTS.md` — detailed orientation for AI agents and new contributors (repo state,
  architecture reference, package map, implementation phases, guardrails).
- `CLAUDE.md` — guidance for Claude Code sessions.
- `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `MEMORY.md` — root tracking files.
- `docs/archive/` — archive location for the original specification PDF.
- `.claude/settings.json` — registers the `local-marketplace` plugin marketplace
  (`danielsimonjr/skills` on GitHub) and enables three portable skill plugins as project
  defaults: `rfl`, `dev-workflow`, `honest-claude`.
- Directory tree built out from the specification: every `packages/*` package gained a
  `README.md` (responsibilities + spec references) plus `src/` and `tests/` placeholders;
  `examples/` gained the §93 quick-start examples and the two flagship demos (§118–119);
  `tests/` gained `integration/`, `visual/`, and `determinism/` per the §92 taxonomy;
  `benchmarks/`, `tools/`, and `website/` gained purpose READMEs.

#### Changed
- `docs/SPECIFICATION.md` revised to **revision 1.1**, applying all 35 review items from
  `docs/SPEC-REVIEW.md` (owner-directed): contradictions resolved (force API §23/§26,
  authority enums §19/§42 merged into `TransformAuthority` + `"blended"`, 2D gravity sign,
  ms→s time units, `TimeState` completed, accumulator substep clamp); new lettered sections
  6a (Component Model), 6b (Eventing), 7a (Coordinate and Unit Conventions), 7b (Math Type
  Conventions), 60a (Color Management); solver adapter contract extended (destroy/query/
  `drainEvents`, `PhysicsCapabilities` defined); scope settled (audio and networking added
  to §5 non-goals); context-loss handling, precision-at-scale, COOP/COEP, per-backend visual
  baselines, package responsibilities for all 24 packages, Part VII group headings, RFC 2119
  conformance note, Amendments table, and Appendices A (Normative Defaults) and B (Glossary).
  §1–120 numbering unchanged.
- `docs/SPEC-REVIEW.md` header updated with the disposition (all items applied in 1.1;
  §86 payload budget provisional).
- `docs/SPECIFICATION.md` typeset for readability: all 96 code snippets and ASCII diagrams
  fenced (`ts`/`json`/`text`) with indentation restored, `•` bullets converted to Markdown
  lists, the §86 performance targets converted to a real table, and a parts table of
  contents added. Word-for-word equivalence with the pre-typeset text was machine-verified
  (7,257 words preserved exactly); no wording changed.
- `docs/SPECIFICATION.md` rewritten as the **corrected working rendering** of the
  specification (by owner decision): the duplicated `Part VII` became `Part VIII` with later
  parts shifted to IX–XIII (E-1); the twice-assigned section range 45–67 renumbered +53 to
  §98–120, giving one sequence 1–120 (E-2); §102 (Solver Packages) aligned with the monorepo
  tree — `physics-rapier` and `physics-box2d` only (E-3); extraction artifacts repaired
  (kerning splits, ligature, mid-word line-break hyphens); Markdown headings added.
- `docs/ERRATA.md` rewritten as a correction log with a PDF→Markdown numbering map; all
  three defects (E-1, E-2, E-3) marked resolved.
- `README.md` updated to present `SPECIFICATION.md` as the working reference and the PDF as
  the archived original.
- `docs/four-js-specification.pdf` moved unchanged to `docs/archive/`.

### Earlier
- Initial commit: directory scaffold (24 empty `@four/*` package directories, empty
  `examples/`, `benchmarks/`, `tests/`, `tools/`, `website/`), specification PDF and
  extracted Markdown, `ERRATA.md`, `README.md`, MIT `LICENSE`.
