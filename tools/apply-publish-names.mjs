// Applies the §98 publish-name mapping to a staging copy of the workspace.
// Usage:
//   node tools/apply-publish-names.mjs             (check only — writes nothing)
//   node tools/apply-publish-names.mjs --out=<dir> (write the staging tree)
//   exit 0 = clean, 1 = problems
//
// The owner decided on 2026-07-29 (spec §98, revision 1.6) that the workspace
// keeps its short internal names — `four` and `@four/*` — and that the published
// names live in the owner's personal npm scope: `four` → `@danielsimonjr/fourjs`
// and `@four/<name>` → `@danielsimonjr/fourjs-<name>`. The spec says the mapping
// "is applied mechanically at release time"; this is that mechanism.
//
// Two rules shape the whole script:
//
//   1. **Never in place.** Renaming packages in the checkout would leave a
//      developer — or a half-finished CI job — with a tree whose imports no
//      longer match its manifests, and a `git status` that invites committing
//      the rename. Everything is written under `--out`; the workspace is only
//      ever read. The release workflow publishes *from* the staging tree.
//
//   2. **Rename and nothing else.** In the manifest the only fields touched are
//      `name`, the four dependency maps' workspace-owned keys, and the
//      `workspace:` ranges those keys carry (which npm cannot resolve — a workspace manager
//      rewrites them during its own publish, and publishing from a staging tree
//      means doing it here). In particular `exports` is copied through
//      untouched: the umbrella's 25 subpath entries are the §91 tree-shaking
//      contract, and a rewrite that quietly dropped or reordered one would be
//      invisible until a consumer's `import "@danielsimonjr/fourjs/scene"`
//      failed. `checkRewrite` asserts it.
//
// The emitted code is renamed too, and it has to be: `tsc` writes the workspace
// specifier straight through, so `packages/animation/dist/index.js` says
// `from "@four/core"`. Publish that beside a manifest whose dependency is now
// `@danielsimonjr/fourjs-core` and every package resolves nothing — the rename
// would ship broken on the first release and look fine in review. `rewriteCode`
// therefore rewrites *quoted* workspace names in the staged `.js`/`.d.ts`: real
// specifiers, the per-package `PACKAGE_NAME` constants, and the `from "four"`
// lines inside JSDoc examples, all of which name the package rather than talk
// about it. Unquoted prose (`` `@four/animation` — the public surface … ``) is
// left alone, and so are READMEs, which already end with their own "Workspace
// name `@four/x`; publishes as `…`" line. Rewriting prose mechanically is a
// different and much riskier job than rewriting a name, and it is not this
// tool's.
