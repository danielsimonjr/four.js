/**
 * Size-limit budget rationale for §86 example bundles (2026-09-07).
 *
 * Limits live in `.size-limit.json`. JSON has no comment field, so A/B
 * justification is recorded here and referenced from that file by path.
 *
 * Measure after `bun run examples:build` with `bun run size`. The numbers
 * below are the CI measurement from `cursor/browser-gate-after-76-8caa`
 * (run 34068239028) after #76 — that PR never reached the size step.
 *
 * | Example            | Measured (gzip) | Prior limit | New limit | Rationale |
 * |--------------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
 * | first-3d-scene     | 42.1 kB         | 39 kB       | 43 kB     | +3.1 kB — #76 production path (gpu-timer getter, resource-memory helpers that DCE, render/particle follow-ups). A: hold at 39 → red; B: 43 kB → ~2 % headroom. |
 * | particles-demo     | 42.21 kB        | 37.5 kB     | 43 kB     | +4.71 kB — R-32 wide instance layout + trail/appearance in the demo graph. B keeps ~1.8 % margin. |
 * | ui-demo            | 48.47 kB        | 46 kB       | 49.5 kB   | +2.47 kB — A-13 a11y mirror + A-5 stats seams already in the retained-mode graph. B avoids toolchain-flake on Vite 8.2. |
 * | flagship           | 1.98 MB         | 1.65 MB     | 2.05 MB   | +328 kB — Rapier 0.20.0 ships larger wasm; this site registers both 2d and 3d adapters. |
 * | motor-digital-twin | 1.22 MB         | 1.00 MB     | 1.25 MB   | +219 kB — one Rapier 0.20 wasm image (directly constructed 3d adapter). |
 * | character-controller | 1.15 MB       | 0.95 MB     | 1.20 MB   | +203 kB — same single 0.20 wasm image as the twin. |
 *
 * first-2d-scene (56.23 / 150 kB) unchanged — still well under §86's
 * minimal-2D-app gate. `__FOUR_DEV__: false` on every production example
 * except the twin; the wasm deltas are the solver bump, not DEV leftovers.
