// It exists because the 2026-08-05 documentation-truth sweep found claims that

// is a specific defect that was fixed by hand once; the check is what stops it
// coming back, since prose has no type checker and no test suite.

// must never try to judge whether a paragraph is true in general — that is a

//   FourError: Application.step() requires an initialized, started, undisposed
//   application: call `await app.initialize()` then `app.start()` (§45).

// The block awaited `initialize()` and went straight into a `requestAnimationFrame`

// no paragraph.
