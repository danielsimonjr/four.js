# MEMORY

Persistent memory for agents and contributors working across sessions: decisions made, facts
that are easy to lose, and conventions in force. Append new entries with a date; never silently
rewrite a recorded decision — supersede it with a new entry. Tasks go in `TODO.md`; released
changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Standing facts

- The repository is **scaffold + specification only** — no implementation, no `package.json`,
  no tooling. There are no build/lint/test commands; don't invent any.
- `docs/SPECIFICATION.md` is the corrected working reference (parts I–XIII, sections 1–120).
  `docs/archive/four-js-specification.pdf` is the unmodified original and still contains the
  old duplicate numbering — translate its references via the map in `docs/ERRATA.md`.
- Plain "§N" citations mean `SPECIFICATION.md` numbering. Cite the PDF explicitly when meant
  ("PDF §49, second range").
- All 24 packages under `packages/` are `@four/`-scoped; `four` is the umbrella package.
  Layering: stable `@four/physics` API above solver adapters; backend-independent `@four/render`
  above `render-*` backends; the logical scene never depends on a concrete backend.

## Decisions

- **2026-07-28 — Spec corrected in place (owner decision).** E-1/E-2/E-3 from `ERRATA.md`
  resolved directly in `SPECIFICATION.md`: second `Part VII` → `Part VIII` (later parts
  IX–XIII); second §45–67 range renumbered +53 to §98–120; §102 lists only `physics-rapier`
  and `physics-box2d` as solver packages. The PDF was left unmodified.
- **2026-07-28 — PDF archived.** Original spec PDF moved to `docs/archive/`; the corrected
  Markdown is the working reference for the repository.
- **2026-07-28 — Plugin marketplace registered (owner decision).** `.claude/settings.json`
  registers `local-marketplace` (GitHub `danielsimonjr/skills`, a **private** repo — sessions
  need the owner's GitHub auth to clone it) and enables `rfl`, `dev-workflow`, and
  `honest-claude` as project defaults. Machine-bound plugins from that marketplace (Windows
  automation, Outlook, local symlink/junction sources, personal MCP servers) are deliberately
  NOT project defaults — they belong in the owner's user-level settings. The settings file
  was created by the owner directly; agent writes to `.claude/settings.json` are blocked by
  the permission classifier in this environment.
- **2026-07-28 — Repository layout conventions.** Per package: `README.md` + `src/`
  (strict TS, ESM) + `tests/` (unit tests colocated, §92). Cross-package suites live in
  `tests/{integration,visual,determinism}/`; performance tests in `benchmarks/`. Examples
  follow §93 naming (`first-*-scene`, `mixed-scene`) with flagship demos under
  `examples/flagship/`. Still no `package.json`/toolchain — that remains Phase 0 (§103).
- **Pre-existing (recorded in ERRATA E-3):** the scaffold follows the monorepo tree —
  `physics-matter` and `physics-cannon` are deliberately absent and must not be added without
  a spec amendment.
- **From the spec (not yet revisited):** first physics adapter is Rapier (§108); MVP renders
  with WebGL 2 only (§120); toolchain baseline is strict TS + ESM + pnpm + Vitest +
  Playwright + ESLint + Prettier + Vite + Changesets (§91).

## Open questions

- Turborepo vs. Nx for the monorepo task runner (§91 permits either).
- Whether/when to regenerate the PDF from the corrected Markdown.

## Gotchas

- The ERRATA "non-defects" list exists so known false alarms aren't rediscovered: §118's
  title starts with a typographic quote (easy to miss in heading scans), and low repeated
  numbers (1., 2., 3., …) in the spec body are lists, not sections.
- The spec body text is hard-wrapped plain text under Markdown headings; code snippets are
  not yet fenced.
