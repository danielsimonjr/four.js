# four.js — Gap Analysis v2

**Date:** 2026-08-29
**Tree ref:** `df572c6` on branch `claude/tools-integration-rji2sr` (working tree clean; this
analysis is read-only apart from the superseded-pointer paragraph it adds to v1 and the
first-run measurement recorded into
`tests/browser/webgpu/webgpu-readpixels-region.spec.ts`'s header per that suite's
convention).
**Supersedes:** `docs/GAP ANALYSIS v1.md` (2026-08-08, tree `e0ddd3b`), which stays in place
as the campaign's running record. Unlike v0 — frozen at filing — v1 was **amended in place**
as the campaign advanced: its rows carry dated closure banners through 2026-08-29, so it is
both the previous analysis and the campaign log. Read v2 for final status; read v1 for the
per-row arguments and the order things fell in; read v0 for why each finding was filed.
**Spec baseline:** `docs/SPECIFICATION.md` revision 1.12 (2026-08-29).

**Method.** v1's method, applied to v1 itself: every filing row (`A-*`, `R-*`, `PH-*`,
`D-*`), every §5 register row, and every closure banner was re-read against source at
`df572c6` — named exports grepped, named files opened, named tests confirmed present and in
the suites — never against `CHANGELOG.md`, `TODO.md`, or `MEMORY.md` alone. Where a claim
names a measurement, the mechanism (benchmark script + committed result) was confirmed
rather than every number re-run. The full house gate suite was then run once, on this tree,
as the campaign-closing verification (§8). Nothing in `packages/*` was edited: a closing
pass records, it does not patch. Where this pass found v1 and the tree disagreeing, the tree
wins and the disagreement is filed in §7 — honesty over tidiness.

The v0 ID space is kept verbatim. `S-*` still means `docs/AUDIT-120.md`'s staged items.

## 1. Executive summary

### Headline

**The campaign is over, and the ledger balances.** Of 97 filings: **74 closed** (each at a
named, dated tier), **21 partially closed** with the residue named and owned, **2 open**
(both minor, both with a staged design and a named owner packet), and **0 blocked on
RFCs** — all five RFCs (0001–0005) were accepted 2026-08-21 and implemented 2026-08-28/29.
The rendering tier, which v1 called "now the project" (26 of 37 open items), collapsed from
26 open to 2: the lighting chain, the 2D vector stack, text, skinning, shader graphs,
picking, raster painting, and the entire WebGPU backend (WP-R1.1–R1.9) all landed between
v1's date and this one.

Honest qualifications, in v1's own tradition:

- "Closed" still means **closed at a named tier**, and the tier is declared in source with a
  dated note naming what it defers. The 21 partial rows and the residue index (§6) are the
  map of what "done" does not include. Nothing was found claiming more than it shipped.
- Four of the 74 closures are **status changes this document itself makes** — rows whose v1
  text lagged the tree (`A-19`, `A-20`, `R-3`, `R-31`; see §7.2). Each was verified in
  source before being counted.
- Every discrepancy this pass found is **documentation-level** (stale or duplicated v1 rows,
  stale tracker lines). No code-level discrepancy was found: every named export, file, test,
  golden, and spec revision that any row claims was verified present at the tip.

### Counts by tier — final

| Tier                      | Filed | Closed | Partially closed | Open |
| ------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ---------------- | ---- |
| Application (`A-1…A-28`)  | 28    | 18     | 10               | 0    |
| Rendering (`R-1…R-41`)    | 41    | 31     | 8                | 2    |
| Simulation (`PH-1…PH-22`) | 22    | 19     | 3                | 0    |
| Doc defects (`D-1…D-6`)   | 6     | 6      | —                | —    |
| **Total**                 | 97    | 74     | 21               | 2    |

v1's duplicate-filing note still applies: `A-2`/`PH-13`, `A-22`/`PH-18`, `A-8`/`R-2`/`PH-19`
and `R-22`/`PH-10` are shared closures, so the 74 represent 69 distinct pieces of work.

### The campaign in five dates

- **2026-08-06/07** — the keystone wave (v1 §2's 42 closures): materials base, sort,
  registries, render targets/graph/effects, physics tuning/serializers, §97a.
- **2026-08-08/09** — the lighting chain (`R-15`→`R-13`→`R-17`→`R-18`), per-view culling
  (`R-8`), batching (`R-9`/`R-10` key 3–4), the whole 2D vector stack
  (`R-25`→`R-24`→`R-23`→`R-16`→`R-26`), force fields (`PH-8`), spaces (`PH-12`), rigs
  (`R-36`), the composition root (`A-6`).
- **2026-08-13** — `Text` (`R-28`) and sampler state (`R-30`).
- **2026-08-21** — the owner decision day: all five RFCs accepted; stencil (`R-7`),
  geometry base (`R-21`), `ScreenCamera` (`R-37`), character controllers (`PH-11`/`11b`),
  rollback (`PH-20`), event-dispatch split (`PH-21`), batched fields (`R-34`), mipmaps
  (`R-30b`), texture loader (`A-19` assets half), WP-R1.1.
- **2026-08-28/29** — the RFC implementations (0002, 0003, 0001, 0005, 0004 in that order),
  §67 clipping, WP-R1.2–R1.9 (**`R-1` closed** — the WebGPU backend is real), GPU particles
  (`R-31`), §82 compute + the `ComputePass` promotion, glTF (`A-19`), analytic picking
  (`A-11`), the §58 paint-object tier (`R-16` final), §61 `readPixels` whole + region
  (`Rectangle2`), the character-controller example (tenth site), and the documentation truth
  sweep.

## 2. Closed — the final ledger

One line per filing: the closure date, and the tier where the closure is narrower than the
spec section. Every pointer named by v1 for these rows was re-verified at `df572c6`; the
per-row arguments live in v1 and in the dated source notes.

## 4. Open (2)

| ID     | §       | State at the tip                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `R-32` | 36      | Feature-tier particle rendering (texture, rotation, `sizeMode`, soft edges, additive blend). The design is staged in v1's row and confirmed against source: it is `render-webgl`'s packet (widen the 8-float instance stream, program variant). Its stated sequencing constraint — after the ScreenCamera wave — has been satisfied since 08-21, so it is schedulable now |
| `R-33` | 112     | The §112 100 000-particle browser measurement. After `R-34` the simulation runs at ~27% of the fixed-step budget on the canonical host, so this is a measurement task with headroom, on hardware that is not SwiftShader; the honest form reports simulate-ms and present-ms separately. The GPU arm now also exists (`R-31`), which the eventual measurement should cover |

## 5. The §5 owner-decision register — final state

Verified row by row against the register itself, the RFCs, the spec's amendments table, and
source.

**Decided and implemented (16 rows).** Rows 1–9 (RFCs 0001/0002/0003 and their questions) —
DECIDED 2026-08-21, IMPLEMENTED 2026-08-28; spec revisions 1.9/1.10/1.11 verified, one
recorded deviation on row 9 (`Bone` carries no `static typeName`; its §79 identity is
`"scene:bone"`). Rows 15–17 (RFC 0004) and 18–20 (RFC 0005) — DECIDED 2026-08-21,
IMPLEMENTED 2026-08-29; §77a + revision 1.12, `ALLOWED_LETTERED`, split colour-space
defaults, `PickingService`/`PickProvider`/Alternative D all verified in source. Rows 21–22
(the R-1 plan's questions) — recommendations adopted in the implementation: registration
stayed an explicit opt-in, the capability record widened once (WP-R1.1), and `ComputePass`
landed in `@four/render` exactly as row 22 recommended (the Q3 promotion, 08-29).

**The owner-only remainder (5 register rows + 6 recorded off-register decisions):**

| Item                                                                             | Where recorded                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Row 10 — stub packaging (publish the five reserved stubs, or restructure)         | Register row 10, `TODO.md` "A-25 owner decisions", `.changeset/README.md`            |
| Row 11 — `NPM_TOKEN` secret; enable Pages                                        | Register row 11, `TODO.md`                                                           |
| Row 12 — §93 stand-in retirement (retire two, write `mixed-scene` — or write all) | Register row 12, `docs/AUDIT-120.md` S-8, `TODO.md`                                  |
| Row 13 — the batched spec-amendment pass. **Correction:** row 13's original four queued items were discharged by revision 1.8 the same day v1 was written (the row was never marked — §7.1). What survives is the *successor* queue: §60's angle operator (RFC 0001's one-row closed-union amendment, conic's sole blocker) and any items queued since | Register row 13; revision 1.8's amendments entry; `TODO.md` (shape-paint row)        |
| Row 14 — payload policy: budget vs the opt-in registry split                     | Register row 14, `MEMORY.md` 2026-08-07 (R-6), `TODO.md`                             |
| `PH-11c` — how much impulse a kinematic character imparts (§26/§23/§32 policy)   | `TODO.md` "PH-11c"; seam named in `swept-character-controller.ts` (`applyImpulseAtPoint` at `ShapeCastHit.point`) |
| §60a defaults flip — move both `"linear"` defaults to sRGB and move goldens deliberately | `MEMORY.md` 2026-08-08 (R-15); dated opt-in notes in source                          |
| Prettier exemption — make the spec's de-facto exemption explicit (`.prettierignore`) | `MEMORY.md` 2026-08-07 gotcha ("owner call: make the exemption explicit")            |
| `PH-22f` — joint anchors' which-pose decision                                    | v1 §4.3, `TODO.md`                                                                   |
| `PH-22j` — §102 solver scope (ERRATA E-3 standing decision)                      | v1 §4.3, `docs/ERRATA.md`                                                            |
| `R-26` `<svg>` document tier — XML-reader seam decision                          | `TODO.md` "R-26 follow-ups"                                                          |

Two smaller recorded owner calls ride along: `PH-22l` (`Clock` naming-only) and `A-24`'s
§83 dispose-after-failed-restore corner (the fix breaks a tested property; needs a policy).

## 6. Residue index

Every staged-with-owner or staged-with-named-packet item at the tip, and where its staging
note lives. (Owner-gated items also appear in §5; this is the complete map.)

- **Owner decisions:** the eleven §5 items above.
- **`@four/render` / backends:** RFC 0005 residue — instanced-particle id arm + two §86
  picking rows (`TODO.md` "RFC 0005 residue"); WebGPU skinned kinds (`R-1` successor filing,
  v1's R-1 row); canvas2d/svg stub tiers (stubs **by decision**, RFC 0004 §6 + `TODO.md`);
  `R-32`'s staged design (v1's row); `R-30` remainder incl. `A-19`'s renderer half
  (`TODO.md` "A-19 remainder"); `R-12`'s four family members (`material.ts`, RFC 0001);
  §52's anti-alias fringe + conic paints (`TODO.md` shape-paint row; `shape-paint.ts`);
  §67 alpha masks / 3D clip planes / per-item scissor (`clip.ts`); tone-mapping operator
  (waits on float targets — `effect-pass.ts` §70 table); `R-10`'s comparator design (v1's
  row); values-as-uniforms lowering for animated gradient stops (`shape-paint.ts`
  determinism section).
- **`@four/assets` / umbrella:** `A-18` remainder (streaming, dependency tracking, progress,
  worker decoding, hot reload — `TODO.md`); `A-16`'s preload-then-catalog wiring + §80
  (v1's row); glTF refusal list widening (CUBICSPLINE → `@four/animation` tangent decision,
  morph targets → RFC 0003 GPU-morph staging — `TODO.md` "A-19 remainder").
- **`@four/ui` / input:** `A-12`'s six remaining widgets, `A-13`'s DOM-gated set
  (`UI_STAGED`, `TODO.md`); §72 dispatch on `PickProvider` results (input packet,
  `TODO.md`).
- **Animation/motion/physics:** `PH-9` residue (`controller.ts`); `PH-12`'s `NodeSpace`
  packet (v1's row); `PH-22i` IK contract (`ik.ts` staging note); the three staged rigs
  (`camera-rigs.ts` / v1's R-36 row); platform carry recipe published
  (`swept-character-controller.ts`).
- **Diagnostics/benchmarks/CI:** `A-27`/`R-39` CI trend job (`benchmarks/README.md`);
  `A-4`/`A-5` catalogues (`TODO.md`); `R-33`'s measurement (v1's row;
  `tests/browser/particles.spec.ts` header states the ~1 800-particle scale);
  `registerRapierSolver` dual-wasm payload — per-dimension registration is the recorded fix
  (`TODO.md`); `INVALID_RENDER_GRAPH` §89 code (R-5 follow-up, `TODO.md`); the §-indexed
  `STAGED.md` both v0 analysts proposed remains unwritten (v1 §6's recommendation stands).

## 7. Discrepancies found by this pass

All are documentation-level. Nothing in `packages/*` was touched; the tracker one-liners are
listed for the owner to land.

### 7.1 Defects inside v1 itself

v1 was amended in place by many hands, and it shows. None of these change any status; they
are why v2 exists as a clean restatement.

1. **The §3 partially-closed table is duplicated wholesale** — a second header row and a
   stale copy of every row follow the current ones (the stale copies lack `R-28`'s `Text`
   landing in `R-27`, carry the older `R-39`, and omit `R-9`).
2. **§4.1 duplicates `R-28`/`R-29`/`R-30`** — the second `R-28` copy is the pre-close "No
   `Text` node" text, contradicting the closed row above it.
3. **§4.1 duplicates `R-36`/`R-37`** — the second `R-36` copy is the stale "PARTLY CLOSED
   (helper tier)" text.
4. **§4.6 Group 3 and Group 7 paragraphs are each duplicated/garbled** mid-sentence where
   updates were appended rather than merged.
5. **`A-24`'s row is malformed** in both copies of the §3 table (a five-column v0-format row
   in a four-column table).
6. **§1's executive counts were frozen at 2026-08-08** (42/14/4/37) while the rows beneath
   them closed in place — by the tip they contradict the document's own banners. §1 above is
   the corrected final count.
7. **Register row 13 was never marked** although revision 1.8 discharged its four queued
   items on v1's own date (§5).
8. **Stale row details:** `R-12` still says "eight §57 members missing" (four are
   shipped-or-settled); `R-27`'s residue still lists `Mesh` (shipped 08-28); `A-12` still
   counts canvas view as missing (shipped 08-29); v1 §4.5's "§97a is already partially
   stale" bullet was discharged by revision 1.8, its "graph artifacts are stale" bullet by
   the tip commit (`df572c6` regenerates them), and its `color.ts`-at-0% bullet by `R-15`
   (100×4 at the tip).

### 7.2 Rows whose status v2 itself changes (verified in source first)

- **`A-20` → CLOSED 2026-08-29.** v1's row still reads "still literally silent"; the tree
  disagrees: `ComputePass` is a `@four/render` descriptor (the Q3 promotion), WebGPU
  implements `compute()` with exact browser-proven readback (WP-R1.8), WebGL 2's answer is
  the structural absence §62's capability record reports, and `CHANGELOG.md` carries two
  dated entries. Silent in neither code nor record.
- **`R-3` → CLOSED (widening 2026-08-21, declaration API 2026-08-29).** v1's row still
  reads "2 of 11 categories, no declaration API"; `renderer.ts` carries §62's full record
  (13 members) and `RendererResolveOptions.capabilities` is the declaration API, consumed by
  `"auto"` and by `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`'s regenerated table.
- **`A-19` → CLOSED at the loader tier 2026-08-29.** v1's row wording lags the tree:
  `CHANGELOG.md` and `TODO.md` record the closure with the renderer-side residue re-owned
  under `R-30`'s remainder row — where it belongs, since every remaining item is renderer
  work.
- **`R-31` → counted closed.** v1's own banner says CLOSED (mechanism 08-29, wiring 08-29)
  but the row still sits in the "open" table; v2 files it in §2.

### 7.3 Tracking-file staleness (for the orchestrator's landing pass)

- `TODO.md`'s RFC-queue row still says "Remaining R-1 packets: WP-R1.8 (in flight), WP-R1.9"
  — both landed 08-29.
- `TODO.md` carries stale unchecked duplicates below their DONE rows: "A-11 / RFC 0005 —
  owner decision", "A-11 analytic tier", and a second "Character-controller example
  follow-up".
- `TODO.md`'s RFC 0004 residue row ends in a garbled fragment ("listed as guide
  15).ts`'s header and §77a).").
- The two pre-existing Prettier warnings the R-5 follow-up names remain (the repo-wide
  `prettier --check` is not a gate; the spec-exemption decision is §5's).

### 7.4 Code-level discrepancies

**None found.** Every export, file, test, golden, benchmark result, spec revision and
tooling gate named by a v1 row was verified present and as described at `df572c6`.

## 9. Closing observations

- **The tier discipline held to the end.** Every closure re-verified for this document
  declares its tier in source with a dated note naming what it defers, and no tier label
  was found overstating what shipped. The one thing that rotted was v1's own text — rows
  edited in place by many hands accumulated duplicates and stale copies (§7.1). The lesson
  v1 drew about tracking files ("a batch that lands code without touching a tracking file is
  invisible within a day") has a v2 corollary: **a status document amended in place by many
  hands needs a closing re-read by one** — which is this document.
- **Byte-identity remained the working discipline** through the largest packets of the
  campaign (R-1's transcript-identity tests across three backends, R-16's
  registered-vs-not transcripts, RFC 0001's node-free identity), and it is still why the
  closures are trustworthy.
- **The remaining work has no internal blockers.** Both open rows are schedulable today;
  all 21 partial rows name their residue and its owner; everything owner-gated is
  enumerated in §5. The free list is empty in the only sense that matters: nothing waits on
  anything but a decision or a scheduled packet.
