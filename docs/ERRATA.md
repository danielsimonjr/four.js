# Specification Errata and Correction Log

[`archive/four-js-specification.pdf`](archive/four-js-specification.pdf) (65 pages) contains internal defects,
recorded here as E-1, E-2, and E-3. **All three are now resolved in
[`SPECIFICATION.md`](SPECIFICATION.md)**, which was corrected by decision of the specification's
author (2026-07-28) and is the working reference for this repository. The PDF is preserved
unchanged as the original source and **still contains the defects** — use this file to translate
between the two.

## E-1 — `Part VII` was used for two different parts — ✅ RESOLVED

The PDF contains two distinct parts both labelled `Part VII`:

| Occurrence | Heading | Covers (PDF numbering) |
|---|---|---|
| First | `Part VII - Complete Graphics, Rendering, Application, and Platform Architecture` | §45 *Application Model* → §67 *Clipping, Masks, and Stencils* (continuing to §97) |
| Second | `Part VII - Package Architecture` | §45 *Proposed Monorepo* → §49 *Solver Packages* |

**Resolution applied in `SPECIFICATION.md`:** the second occurrence became a new
`Part VIII - Package Architecture`, and every later part shifted by one:

| PDF | SPECIFICATION.md |
|---|---|
| Part VII - Complete Graphics, Rendering, Application, and Platform Architecture | Part VII (unchanged) |
| Part VII - Package Architecture | **Part VIII** |
| Part VIII - Implementation Plan | **Part IX** |
| Part IX - Public API Examples | **Part X** |
| Part X - Flagship Demonstrations | **Part XI** |
| Part XI - Revised MVP | **Part XII** |
| Part XII - Final Design Statement | **Part XIII** |

## E-2 — Section numbers 45–67 were assigned twice — ✅ RESOLVED

In the PDF, the second `Part VII` restarts section numbering at 45, so the range 45–67 is used
twice and bare references like "§49" are ambiguous.

**Resolution applied in `SPECIFICATION.md`:** the first range (§1–97) is unchanged; the second
range was renumbered by **+53** to §98–120, giving a single sequence 1–120. Map for the
renumbered sections:

| PDF § | SPECIFICATION.md § | Title |
|---|---|---|
| 45 | 98 | Proposed Monorepo |
| 46 | 99 | Motion Package |
| 47 | 100 | Animation Package |
| 48 | 101 | Physics Package |
| 49 | 102 | Solver Packages |
| 50 | 103 | Phase 0 - Project Foundation |
| 51 | 104 | Phase 1 - Math, Scene, and Time |
| 52 | 105 | Phase 2 - Motion Foundation |
| 53 | 106 | Phase 3 - Renderer Foundation |
| 54 | 107 | Phase 4 - Animation Core |
| 55 | 108 | Phase 5 - Physics API and First Solver Adapter |
| 56 | 109 | Phase 6 - Joints and Constraints |
| 57 | 110 | Phase 7 - Physics-Animation Integration |
| 58 | 111 | Phase 8 - Advanced Motion |
| 59 | 112 | Phase 9 - Particles and GPU Motion |
| 60 | 113 | Phase 10 - Replay, Snapshots, and Diagnostics |
| 61 | 114 | Basic Animated Object |
| 62 | 115 | Dynamic Physics Object |
| 63 | 116 | Motorized Hinge |
| 64 | 117 | Physics and Animation Blend |
| 65 | 118 | "One Scene, Everything Moves" |
| 66 | 119 | Engineering Demonstration |
| 67 | 120 | MVP Requirements |

Citation convention: plain section references (e.g. "§102") now mean `SPECIFICATION.md`
numbering. When citing the PDF, say so explicitly (e.g. "PDF §49, second range").

## E-3 — Solver packages contradiction — ✅ RESOLVED

The PDF's *Solver Packages* section (PDF §49, second range) named four solver adapter packages
(`physics-rapier`, `physics-box2d`, `physics-matter`, `physics-cannon`), while the *Proposed
Monorepo* tree (PDF §45, second range) listed only `physics-rapier`, `physics-box2d`, and
`physics-soft` (a soft-body package, not a solver adapter). A full cross-check of every
`@four/<pkg>` reference found no other mismatches.

**Resolution (owner decision, previously recorded here and now applied to the text):** the
monorepo tree wins. §102 (Solver Packages) in `SPECIFICATION.md` now lists only
`@four/physics-rapier` and `@four/physics-box2d`, with a note that Matter.js and Cannon-es
(potential adapters per §37) may be added by future amendment. The scaffold contains
`physics-rapier`, `physics-box2d`, and `physics-soft` only; `physics-matter` and
`physics-cannon` must not be added without a further amendment.

## Extraction artifacts — ✅ REPAIRED

`SPECIFICATION.md` originally carried PDF text-extraction noise, all repaired in the corrected
rendering: kerning splits (`AScene`, `A void`, `A VIF`, `W orker-rendering`, `T ests`,
`Digital T win`, `T ooling`), the `eﬀicient` ligature, mid-word line-break hyphens (e.g.
`appli-`/`cation`), and the wrapped subtitle. Two line-end hyphens were genuine compounds and
were preserved: `human-readable`, `vector-level`. The corrected rendering also adds Markdown
headings (`##` parts, `###` sections); no normative wording was changed other than the E-3
resolution described above.

## Scope note: revisions vs. errata

This file covers only the PDF's extraction/numbering defects and their resolution.
Substantive amendments to the specification (revision 1.1 applying `SPEC-REVIEW.md` R-1–R-35,
revision 1.2 confirming the §86 payload budget) are recorded in the **amendments table at the
top of `SPECIFICATION.md`**, not here. The archived PDF is **frozen at the pre-1.0 text**: it
predates all revisions in addition to carrying the defects above.

## Non-defects (checked and dismissed)

Recorded so they are not "rediscovered" later:

- **Section 65 (PDF second range; now §118) is not missing.** Its title begins with a
  typographic quote (`"One Scene, Everything Moves"`), which heading scans can miss.
- **Repeated low numbers (1., 2., 3., …) scattered through the text are numbered *lists*,**
  not sections — e.g. the four fundamentals in §1 *Vision*. Only the PDF's 45–67 range was a
  genuine collision.
