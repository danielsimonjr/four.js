# Custom shaders

§60 specifies a shader and node-material system: a node-based material graph,
reflection metadata, and safe shader/plugin boundaries (§96). **It landed.**
RFC 0001 (accepted 2026-08-21) shipped on 2026-08-28: the shader-graph IR and
the authoring builders live in `four/materials`, the §70 screen half in
`four/render`, and each GPU backend carries an opt-in emitter —
`registerNodeMaterialPipeline()` on WebGL 2 (2026-08-28) and
`registerWebgpuNodeMaterialPipeline()` on WebGPU (WP-R1.9, 2026-08-29). This
guide said "there is no custom shader API yet … expect a declarative surface
rather than raw string injection" until 2026-08-29; what landed is exactly
that declarative surface, so this is now the guide to it.

## The unit of extension is a graph, never a source string

Nothing in the public surface accepts GLSL or WGSL text, at any tier, and that
is the design rather than a gap (§96, made binding by spec revision 1.11):

- §57's `ShaderMaterial` is recorded as **permanently unshipped** (RFC 0001
  Q1, owner decision). `NodeMaterial` is the material family's one sanctioned
  extension surface.
- Shading is a `ShaderGraph` — a JSON-serializable IR over a **closed** set of
  operators (`packages/materials/src/shader-graph.ts`). An operator the
  repository has not implemented is a compile error, never a value a backend
  quietly drops; widening the set is a versioned, reviewed act.
- Because the graph is data, every texture it samples is enumerable
  (`analyzeShaderGraph`), which is what lets `RenderGraph.validate()` run its
  feedback and ordering checks over a custom pass exactly as over a built-in
  one. A scene document can carry a picture, never a program.

## A first node material

`NodeMaterialBuilder` is the fluent authoring surface; `build()` validates the
graph and wraps it in a `NodeMaterial`, which is an ordinary §57 material —
hand it to a `Renderable` like any other:

```ts
import { planeGeometry } from "four/geometry";
import { NodeMaterialBuilder } from "four/materials";
import { Renderable, Texture } from "four/render";

const texture = new Texture({ width: 4, height: 4, data: rgbaBytes });

const builder = new NodeMaterialBuilder();
const albedo = builder.texture(texture); // sampled at the mesh uv by default
const tint = builder.uniform("tint", "vec3");
const pulse = builder.sin(builder.time().multiply(2)).multiply(0.5).add(0.5);
builder.output.color = albedo
  .multiply(builder.vec4(tint.multiply(pulse), 1))
  .saturate();

const material = builder.build();
material.setUniform("tint", [1, 0.6, 0.2]);

const quad = new Renderable(planeGeometry({ width: 1, height: 1 }), material);
```

Facts worth knowing before you fight them:

- **The graph is immutable** — frozen at construction. Changing shading means
  building a new graph and a new material; that is what makes a backend's
  program cache a pure function of the graph.
- **One program per distinct graph, however many materials share it.** Each
  `NodeMaterial` owns its own uniform values and texture bindings
  (`setUniform` / `setTexture`), uploaded per draw; writing them does **not**
  bump `Material.version`, exactly like the rest of §57's render state
  (RFC 0001 Q3 — per-_node_ values are deferred with uniform blocks).
- **Validation happens at setup, loudly** (§85). A broken graph is refused
  with a `RangeError` naming the node while the code that built it is on the
  stack — a backend never validates inside a frame (§61).
- `builder.time()` reads §9 **render** time, never simulation time: a shader
  is a rendering artefact, and nothing downstream of one may become simulation
  input (§42/§43).

## Registering a backend's node pipeline

The emitters are the largest modules either backend owns, so neither is linked
by default — an application opts in with one call per backend, the same seam
as `registerWebglRenderer()` and the §37 solver registry:

```ts
import { Application } from "four/application";
import {
  registerNodeMaterialPipeline,
  registerWebglRenderer,
} from "four/render-webgl";

registerWebglRenderer(); // §62 registry: "auto" can now pick WebGL 2
registerNodeMaterialPipeline(); // §60: links the GLSL emitter + program cache

const app = new Application({ renderer: "auto", canvas });
await app.initialize();
```

On WebGPU the pair is `registerWebgpuRenderer()` and
`registerWebgpuNodeMaterialPipeline()` from `four/render-webgpu` (the WGSL
emitter, WP-R1.9). Registration compiles nothing: programs compile lazily, per
distinct graph, on the first draw that needs one.

**An unregistered node material is skipped, not drawn flat**, with a one-time
§85 development warning naming the fix. A graph the author wrote is a specific
picture, and drawing an unrelated one would be worse than drawing nothing
(RFC 0001 §4).

## The operator set, closed on purpose

Sources: `constant` (numbers and 2–4/9/16-component arrays), `uniform`,
`attribute`, `texture`/`sampler`, `time`. Structure: `vec2`/`vec3`/`vec4`
composition and `swizzle` (`xyzw` patterns). Math: the unary set `sin`, `cos`,
`abs`, `floor`, `fract`, `normalize`, `negate`, `saturate`, `length`; the
binary set `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `min`, `max`, `dot`,
`step`; and `mix`. That is all of it — anything else is a compile error today
and a reviewed widening tomorrow.

Two domains, fixed at builder construction:

- **`"surface"`** (the `NodeMaterialBuilder` default) shades a `Renderable`
  and may read the four R-19 vertex attributes: `position`, `normal`, `uv`,
  `color`.
- **`"screen"`** shades a §70 full-screen pass; only `"uv"` is readable there
  (the pass's own normalized coordinate — there is no mesh).

Bounds, checked at validation: at most `MAX_SHADER_GRAPH_NODES = 1024` nodes
and `MAX_SHADER_GRAPH_TEXTURES = 8` distinct samplers per graph (§96 input
bounds — a graph is JSON a scene document may some day carry).

## Vertex displacement

A `"surface"` graph may assign `output.positionOffset` — a `vec3` object-space
displacement added to `position`:

```ts
const builder = new NodeMaterialBuilder();
const position = builder.attribute("position");
const wave = builder
  .sin(position.swizzle("x").multiply(6).add(builder.time()))
  .multiply(0.1);
builder.output.color = builder.constant([0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1]);
builder.output.positionOffset = builder.vec3(0, wave, 0);
const material = builder.build();
```

A displacement is **not** a transform: §42's authority model is untouched and
the physics world is not told — a displacing material on a collider draws away
from where it collides, by decision (RFC 0001 Q4). Texture nodes cannot feed
`positionOffset` at this tier (the displacement runs in the vertex stage,
where implicit-derivative sampling does not exist); the graph is refused at
validation rather than left to a driver.

## Screen graphs: custom full-screen passes (§70)

The same IR in the `"screen"` domain is `GraphEffect` — §70's "custom
full-screen passes", as data, driven through the `RenderGraph` like every
built-in effect. `ShaderGraphBuilder` (the domain-agnostic base) authors it;
the `"source"` sampler is the pass's input, and uniform values live on the
pass:

```ts
import { ShaderGraphBuilder } from "four/materials";
import { RenderGraph, RenderTarget } from "four/render";

const sceneColor = new RenderTarget({ width: 512, height: 512 });

const screen = new ShaderGraphBuilder("screen");
const texel = screen.sampler("source");
const gain = screen.uniform("gain", "float");
screen.output.color = screen.vec4(
  texel.swizzle("xyz").multiply(gain),
  texel.swizzle("w"),
);

const graph = new RenderGraph();
graph.addPass("world", { root: scene, views, target: sceneColor });
graph.addPass(
  "warm",
  {
    kind: "effect",
    source: sceneColor.colorTexture,
    effect: { kind: "graph", graph: screen.graph(), uniforms: { gain: 1.2 } },
  },
  { inputs: ["world"] },
);
graph.execute(renderer);
```

A graph naming samplers beyond `"source"` declares each in
`GraphEffect.textures`, which is precisely what keeps the pass's full sample
set visible to `RenderGraph.validate()` — a `GraphEffect` pass does **not**
emit the `"opaque"` issue a `CustomRenderPass` does, because the graph can see
inside it. `"screen"` graphs must omit `positionOffset` (no vertices to move).

## Unlit at this tier, stated rather than softened

A node material does not see §68's directional light, the punctual lights, or
the scene ambient term — RFC 0001 §6 records this as the MVP's sharpest
limitation. It is enough for §70 effects, procedural colour, exact §58
gradients, UV animation and screen-space work; it is not the PBR path. For lit
surfaces use `LitMaterial` or `StandardMaterial`; lighting-aware graphs wait
on a light-uniform contract §68's tier does not have yet.

## What stays deferred (RFC 0001 residue, staged in source 2026-08-28)

- **Uniform blocks** (std140, with a measurement first) — also the gate on
  per-node uniform values.
- **Reusable functions** (named subgraphs need an emission scope and a
  call-site key) and **conditional variants** (a second program-cache
  dimension).
- **Storage buffers** (§82, WebGPU) and **source maps** (per-node provenance;
  today the error path ships the emitted source plus the driver log).
- **Lighting-aware graphs** (above).
- **Data-declared custom operators** (RFC 0001's alternative E — a follow-up
  RFC, and the gate on §81's `materials/shader nodes` plugin token).
- **An angle operator**, which is what unlocks §58's conic gradient; and the
  §58 Paint-object tier on `Shape2D` (R-16's shape-paint packet, unblocked by
  this landing but not part of it).
