# Fixed-step simulation

Simulation in four.js advances in **fixed steps**; rendering runs at whatever
rate the display refreshes and draws **interpolated** poses. This guide covers
the §10 loop, the §9 time domains, §39 system ordering, and the §43
interpolation that ties them together. It is the single most load-bearing
design in the engine: determinism (§33), replay (§34), and physics stability
(§41) all rest on it.

## Start-up order

Three calls have to happen in one order, and it is not the order the code reads in:

1. `await world.initialize()` — **before the first `addBody`.** A WebAssembly solver
   decodes its module here (§37), so a world that has not initialized has nothing to
   register a body with. `addBody` throws rather than guess.
2. `await app.initialize()`
3. `app.start()` — before the first `app.step(…)`. §45 rejects a step on an application
   that was initialized but never started.

The trap is step 1. Everywhere else in four you build a scene and then initialize it, so
"construct the world, add the bodies, initialize" is the natural guess and it fails:

```text
FourError: PhysicsWorld has not been initialized; await world.initialize() before
registering bodies or stepping (§37: a WebAssembly solver loads its module there).
```

`examples/mechanism` shows the working sequence: both `initialize` calls, and only then
the function that creates every body and joint.


## The accumulator (§10)

`app.step(elapsedSeconds)` feeds real elapsed time into an accumulator. Each
call runs zero or more fixed steps of `fixedTimeStep` seconds (default 1/60,
Appendix A), clamped at `maximumSubSteps` (default 5); excess time is
**dropped**, not simulated, and surfaced as `TimeState.droppedTime` so a slow
machine slows down instead of spiralling. The remainder becomes
`interpolationAlpha` — how far between the last two simulation states the
frame being drawn sits.

The wall clock is allowed in exactly one place: the frame loop boundary,
where the rAF timestamp is converted to seconds. Inside the engine every
system receives the same injected `fixedDeltaTime`; nothing reads a clock
(§33).

```ts
let last: number | null = null; // seed from the FIRST rAF timestamp
function frame(now: number): void {
  if (last !== null) {
    app.step((now - last) / 1000); // milliseconds → seconds at the boundary
  }
  last = now;
  requestAnimationFrame(frame);
}
```

## A complete headless example

`Application` runs without a renderer — the default is headless — which is
how the determinism suites and benchmarks drive it, and the easiest way to
see the loop's anatomy. This runs under Node:

```ts
import { Application } from "four/application";
import { Vector3 } from "four/math";
import { MotionComponent, MotionSystem } from "four/motion";
import { Group } from "four/scene";

const app = new Application({ fixedTimeStep: 1 / 60, maximumSubSteps: 5 });

const spinner = new Group();
spinner.transformAuthority = "kinematic";
spinner.addComponent(
  new MotionComponent({ angularVelocity: new Vector3(0, 0, 1) }),
);
app.scene.add(spinner);

const motion = new MotionSystem();
app.systems.register(motion);
motion.track(spinner);

let fixedSteps = 0;
app.on("fixedUpdate", (time) => {
  fixedSteps += 1; // fires once per fixed step: 0..maximumSubSteps per app.step
  void time.fixedDeltaTime; // always exactly 1/60 here
});
app.on("update", (time) => {
  // once per app.step, after that call's fixed steps have run
  void time.interpolationAlpha; // 0..1, the render-side blend factor
});

await app.initialize();
app.start();
app.step(0.05); // 3 fixed steps run (48 ms simulated), 2 ms accumulates
console.log(fixedSteps); // 3
```

## Time domains (§9)

`TimeState` distinguishes the clocks so each system can pick the right one:

| domain     | fields                                               | who uses it                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| real       | `realTime`                                           | profiling, presentation    |
| render     | `renderTime`, `interpolationAlpha`                   | drawing, §43 interpolation |
| simulation | `simulationTime`, `simulationStep`, `fixedDeltaTime` | physics, motion, animation |
| scaled     | time-scale-adjusted simulation time                  | slow motion, pause         |
| dropped    | `droppedTime`                                        | overload diagnostics       |

Animation time is clip-local on top of these. Slow motion scales simulation
time; it never changes `fixedDeltaTime`, so physics stays stable at any time
scale.

## System ordering (§39)

Systems register on `app.systems` and run per fixed step in **priority
order**, whatever order you register them. The shipped priorities:

```text
299  createPoseTargetCaptureSystem  (§19 pose history — register it yourself when blending)
300  AnimationSystem                (animation writes values / pose targets)
400  MotionSystem / KinematicSystem (kinematics integrates)
500  ParticleSystem                 (force generation)
600  PhysicsSystem                  (solve, then §29 event dispatch after the step)
     pose snapshot                  (§43 capture, registered by Application)
```

That order _is_ §19's pipeline — animation pose → kinematic modification →
physics solve — so blending needs no extra machinery, just the priorities.

## Interpolated rendering (§43)

Rendering never shows raw simulation state for moving nodes. `app.poses` is a
`PoseBuffer`: every tracked node's position and rotation are captured after
each fixed step, and the frame is drawn from
`lerp/slerp(previous, current, interpolationAlpha)`. Track every mover:

```ts
app.poses.track(spinner); // untracked nodes draw from their live transform
```

`PhysicsWorld` tracks its dynamic bodies automatically when constructed with
`poses: app.poses`. Two rules keep the design sound: interpolation **never
feeds back** into simulation state (§42), and a per-step measurement (from
`fixedUpdate`) is the only honest place to look for discontinuities — a
per-frame number folds several steps together.

One consequence worth knowing: the accumulator's floating-point drift can
fire a timeline marker sitting exactly on a step boundary one step late.
This is frozen, pinned behaviour (`golden/phase4.json`) — do not place
markers on exact step boundaries and expect step-exact firing.
