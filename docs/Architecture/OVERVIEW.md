# four.js — Project Overview

_"One scene. Every dimension. Everything moves."_

A unified TypeScript framework combining 2D, 2.5D, and 3D graphics with
animation, motion systems, and physics in a **single shared scene model**: 2D
shapes, 3D meshes, text, UI, rigid bodies, joints, and particle emitters all
live in one scene graph with one clock, one transform-authority model, one
event system, and one set of conventions. Deterministic fixed-step simulation
with snapshots and replay is a first-class requirement, not an afterthought.

Workspace packages are `@four/*`-scoped (umbrella: `four`); the decided publish
names are **`@danielsimonjr/fourjs`** (umbrella) and
`@danielsimonjr/fourjs-<name>` (sub-packages). Nothing is published yet — the
mechanical rename happens in the release workflow at first publish (§94, 0.1).

Section references like "§42" mean [`docs/SPECIFICATION.md`](../SPECIFICATION.md)
numbering — the working reference whose current revision is whatever tops the
amendments table at its top. The outward-facing why-exist case is
[`docs/POSITIONING.md`](../POSITIONING.md).

## Why it exists, in one paragraph

An interactive 2D/3D web app today is an integration project: three.js for 3D,
Pixi or Canvas for 2D, Rapier or Matter for physics, GSAP for animation, DOM
for UI — five libraries, five scene models, five clocks, five coordinate
conventions. The glue is where projects bleed: render meshes chasing physics
bodies a frame late, tweens fighting physics for the same transform,
milliseconds in one API and seconds in another, and no story for determinism
or replay. four.js's bet is that **the integration itself is the product**.
The first audience is engineering/simulation web apps and digital twins (which
need determinism, replay, explicit units, and mixed 2D diagrams + 3D models),
then interactive-content developers, then games.

## The four pillars

Four coequal architectural pillars (§3) over one shared scene graph:

| Pillar      | Responsibility                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Scene**   | Hierarchy, transforms, visibility, grouping, ownership                                                             |
| **Render**  | Logical scene state → pixels, behind a backend-independent renderer interface (§61)                                |
| **Motion**  | Deterministic change through time: velocity/acceleration, trajectories, kinematic control, steering, interpolation |
| **Physics** | Forces, mass, collisions, constraints, joints, fields — a stable API (§20) above pluggable solver adapters (§37)   |

The recurring distinction: _animation_ specifies how something **should** move,
_kinematics_ moves objects directly, _dynamics_ derives motion from forces —
all supported, with controlled blending between them (§19) governed by a
single transform-authority model (§42).

## Key capabilities

The full dependency analysis (every file, import, and export) is autogenerated
into [DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md](./DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md); the layering rules and the
frozen dependency matrix behind it are explained in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Package map (24 packages)

All workspace packages are `@four/`-scoped; the scaffold matches the §98
monorepo tree exactly. "Wave" is the build/dispatch layer from the frozen
dependency matrix (implementation plan §3.1).

| Package          | Wave | Responsibility                                                                                                                       | Status                       |

The four reserved stubs (`physics-box2d`, `physics-soft`, `render-canvas`,
`render-svg`) each contain a single placeholder file exporting
`PACKAGE_NAME`, and their READMEs say so honestly ("interface reserved; not
yet implemented"). `@four/render-webgpu` left that list 2026-08-21…29 (the
R-1 plan). Per ERRATA E-3, `physics-matter` and `physics-cannon`
directories must **not** be added without a spec amendment.

## Conventions everything assumes

- **Right-handed, Y-up world — in 2D and 3D alike** (§7a). 2D gravity is
  negative Y. Front faces are CCW.
- **Radians** in all APIs; **all engine times are seconds** — tween and
  timeline durations included, never milliseconds.
- Math types are **mutable**; in-place methods return `this`; hot paths take
  `out` parameters; no steady-state per-frame allocation (§7b).
- Simulation advances in **fixed steps**; rendering runs at its own rate and
  interpolates between the previous and current simulation state (§10, §43).
- **Exactly one system owns a node's transform** at a time (§42); conflicts
  warn in development, never silently overwrite.
- Units are explicit (§40): default meter/kilogram/second/radian, but the
  1 unit = 1 meter assumption is never hard-coded.
- Imports use the umbrella package's subpaths, exactly as the examples do:

  ```ts
  import { Application } from "four/application";

## Current implementation status

All thirteen phases of the implementation plan (§103–§113a, executed via
[`docs/plans/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](../plans/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)) are
closed, and the §120 MVP audit stands at **43/43 items shipped-or-MVP** since
the lighting packet landed (2026-08-04). As of 2026-08-05:

- **3,083 unit tests** (colocated per package) + **174 cross-package suite
  tests** (`tests/{integration,visual,determinism}/`) + **38 browser/visual
  Playwright tests**, coverage gates ≥ 95% everywhere.
- §86 payload gate: the minimal 2D app (core + math + scene + render-webgl) is
  **33.28 kB gzip against the 150 kB budget**.
- Determinism goldens are bit-exact in-process and across fresh processes;
  TypeDoc builds with 0 warnings.

Honesty about what is _not_ there yet — staged features carry dated staging
notes at their would-be home in the source:

- **Backends/solvers**: WebGPU, Canvas 2D, SVG renderers and the Box2D and
  soft-body packages are reserved stubs (see the table above).
- **Rendering**: shadows (§69), `StandardMaterial`/PBR (§59), color strings
  and tone mapping (§60a), point/spot/hemisphere/area lights and multi-light,
  §63's transient-target/lifetime/barrier tier (the linear-pass `RenderGraph` shipped
  2026-08-07), GPU compute (§82).
- **Content**: glTF loading (§78), SDF/shaped text (§56 full tier),
  morph/skeletal animation tracks, distance and gear joints (§28).
- **Platform**: workers (§88) — the engine is main-thread today, with APIs
  deliberately shaped not to preclude worker migration; UI accessibility
  DOM mirror and screen-reader support (§75 — keyboard navigation shipped
  2026-08-07).
