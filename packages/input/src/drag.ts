/**
 * Dragging (§72, §120): press a node, move the pointer, get world-space deltas.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const drags = new DragManager({
 *   pointerInput,
 *   onDrag: (node, worldDelta) => {
 *     node.transform.position.add(worldDelta);   // the application writes, not input
 *   },
 * });
 * drags.makeDraggable(box);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why the callback writes and this class does not (§42)
 *
 * §42 gives exactly one system authority over a node's transform, and conflicts
 * must warn rather than silently overwrite. Input is not on that list — there is
 * no `"input"` authority — and for good reason: what a drag *means* is the
 * application's decision. Dragging a `"manual"` node moves it; dragging a
 * `"physics"` node should apply a force or switch the body to kinematic for the
 * duration; dragging a node under an animation may be forbidden outright. A
 * drag manager that wrote `node.transform.position` directly would make that
 * choice for everyone and would silently fight the owning system.
 *
 * So this class computes the one thing only it can compute — the world-space
 * displacement corresponding to the pointer's motion — and hands it to
 * {@link DragManagerOptions.onDrag}. The callback runs under whatever authority
 * the application has arranged; {@link DragManagerOptions.onDragStart} and
 * {@link DragManagerOptions.onDragEnd} exist precisely so it can take and hand
 * back that authority around the gesture.
 *
 * ## How the world delta is computed
 *
 * A pointer moves on the screen; a node moves in the world. The mapping between
 * them needs a plane to move *on*, and the one that behaves the way people
 * expect — the object stays under the finger — is the plane through the grab
 * point, parallel to the camera's near plane.
 *
 * Both projections are handled by unprojecting the two pointer positions onto
 * the **near plane** (`createPickRay`'s origin is exactly that point) and
 * taking the difference:
 *
 * - **Orthographic — exact.** Rays are parallel, so a near-plane displacement
 *   *is* the world displacement at every depth. This is exact under any affine
 *   camera transform: rotation, non-uniform scale, a parented camera rig —
 *   because the unprojection goes through the camera's world matrix.
 * - **Perspective — distance-proportional (MVP).** Near-plane displacements
 *   grow with depth by similar triangles, so the delta is scaled by
 *   `depth / camera.near`, where `depth` is the grab point's distance along the
 *   view axis, measured **once at drag start**. That is exact while the node
 *   stays on its starting plane, which is what dragging on a plane means, and
 *   it drifts if the callback moves the node towards or away from the camera
 *   (the scale is not recomputed mid-gesture). It also assumes the camera's
 *   world matrix carries no scale — a scaled *perspective* camera mixes camera
 *   units into `near`. Both limits are MVP-tier and documented rather than
 *   guessed around; the exact treatment is a ray/plane intersection against a
 *   drag plane, which belongs with §71's analytic tier.
 *
 * The projection is classified from the projection matrix rather than by
 * `instanceof`: `m[15]` is `1` for an orthographic projection and `0` for a
 * perspective one, whatever the camera class — including the custom-projection
 * cameras §47 requires later.
