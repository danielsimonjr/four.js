/**
 * The keyboard source (§72, 2026-08-07, A-10): platform key events in, scene
 * key events out, routed to whatever holds the focus.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const keyboard = new KeyboardInput(window, {
 *   focusTarget: () => focusedWidget(scene) ?? uiRoot,   // @four/ui answers
 * });
 * button.on("keydown", (event) => { if (event.key === "Enter") activate(); });
 * // …
 * keyboard.dispose();
 * ```
 *
 * The pointer sibling of this class is `PointerInput`, and everything
 * structural about them is deliberately identical: a surface described by the
 * two methods this module actually calls ({@link KeySurface}), a platform event
 * described by the fields it actually reads ({@link SurfaceKeyEvent}), bound
 * listeners stored once so `removeEventListener` gets the same function
 * objects, an idempotent `dispose`, and no DOM lib type named anywhere — so a
 * browser `window`, a `document`, a Playwright-driven page, and a plain object
 * in a unit test are all equally acceptable surfaces.
 *
 * What differs is the one thing that must: **how the target is resolved.** A
 * pointer event has a position, so `PointerInput` picks (§71). A key event does
 * not, so this class asks — once per platform event — the injected
 * {@link KeyboardInputOptions.focusTarget} resolver.
 *
 * ## Why focus is injected rather than owned (decision, A-10)
 *
 * §75's focus lives in `@four/ui`: one focused widget per scene root, with
 * focus/blur events and a disabled/enabled policy this package has no business
 * restating. And plan §3.1 is frozen in the direction that makes that work —
 * `ui` depends on `input`, never the reverse — so `KeyboardInput` **cannot**
 * import `focusedWidget`, and a package-private focus registry here would be a
 * second, competing answer to a question §75 already answers.
 *
 * A one-function seam resolves both problems: the application (or `@four/ui`'s
 * `keyboardFocusTarget` helper) supplies `() => Node | null`, this class calls
 * it per event, and the resolver may return anything — the focused widget, a
 * fallback root so keystrokes still reach a UI tree with nothing focused yet, or
 * `null` for "nobody is listening". It is the same shape as
 * `PointerInputOptions.pickables` for the same reason: a function, so the answer
 * can change without re-creating the input.
 *
 * A resolver returning `null` dispatches nothing at all — the exact analogue of
 * a pointer that hit nothing, and the reason there is no scene-level "the
 * keyboard is idle" event to filter out.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * - It never writes a transform (§42), never touches the scene graph, and holds
 *   no reference to a scene — `PointerInput`'s whole discipline.
 * - It never decides what a key *means*. Tab is not traversal here, Enter is not
 *   activation here: those are §75 policy and live in `@four/ui`. This class
 *   normalizes and routes, which is why it needs no key table at all.
 * - It does not suppress platform defaults on its own. Whoever consumes a key
 *   calls {@link SceneKeyEvent.preventDefault}, which forwards to the platform
 *   event this class hands the scene event — a source that guessed which keys
 *   the application wanted would break the ones it guessed wrong.
 * - It handles `keydown` and `keyup` only; see `key-events.ts` for why
 *   `keypress` is not among them.
