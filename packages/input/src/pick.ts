/**
 * Picking and hit testing (§71) — the bounds tier.
 *
 * §71 asks for "one unified picking API [covering] 2D and 3D" over seven
 * strategies (analytic primitives, bounding volumes, path geometry,
 * ray/triangle, pixel alpha, GPU identifier buffer, custom callbacks). This
 * module ships the **bounding-volume** strategy, which is the one every other
 * strategy is built on top of: a camera ray from a normalized device
 * coordinate, tested against an axis-aligned box per candidate, nearest hit
 * first.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const hits: PickHit[] = [];            // allocated once, reused every pick
 * pick(camera, ndcX, ndcY, pickables, hits);
 * const nearest = hits[0];               // undefined when nothing was hit
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why the candidates are passed in (`Pickable`), not read off the scene
 *
 * `@four/input` depends on `core`, `math`, and `scene` only (plan §3.1). It may
 * not import `@four/render` or `@four/geometry`, so it cannot see `Renderable`
 * or `BufferGeometry` and therefore cannot discover a node's bounds by itself —
 * and reversing that edge to let it try would put input below the renderer in
 * the layering, which the matrix forbids.
 *
 * The consequence is a better API rather than a worse one: picking takes a
 * **structural** candidate list, so anything with a box can be picked — a
 * renderable, a UI rectangle (§73), a collider's local AABB (§21), a hand-built
 * hot zone with no drawn geometry at all. The layer that *does* see geometry
 * builds the list:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // in the application, which may import @four/geometry:
 * const bounds = renderable.geometry.computeBounds();
 * pickables.push({
 *   node: renderable,
 *   boundsMin: bounds.min,
 *   boundsMax: bounds.max,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * `boundsMin`/`boundsMax` are **local** — the node's own space, before its
 * transform — which is exactly what `BufferGeometry.computeBounds()` returns
 * and exactly what a collider descriptor carries. Nothing has to be recomputed
 * when a node moves; a candidate list is rebuilt only when the *set* of
 * candidates changes.
 *
 * ## `node.hitTestMode` (§71; A-11's analytic tier, adopted RFC 0005 Q3)
 *
 * Since 2026-08-29 `Node.hitTestMode` exists and {@link pick} dispatches on it
 * per candidate:
 *
 * - **`null`** — the default, §71's *"the engine should select the cheapest
 *   valid method"*: the box test, refined by whatever data the candidate
 *   carries ({@link Pickable.triangles} first, then {@link Pickable.alphaMask}
 *   sampled at the refined distance). A candidate carrying neither is the
 *   plain bounds tier, byte-for-byte what it was before the field existed.
 * - **`"bounds"`** — the box alone; attached refinement data is deliberately
 *   ignored, because the author forced the cheapest method.
 * - **`"geometry"`** — exact ray/triangle against
 *   {@link Pickable.triangles}, which must be present (§85).
 * - **`"pixel"`** — the box hit must land on a present texel of
 *   {@link Pickable.alphaMask}, which must be present (§85).
 * - **`"gpu"`** — the candidate is skipped before its box is even tested:
 *   RFC 0005's id-buffer pass is that strategy's implementation, reached
 *   through {@link PickProvider}, and one pointer event must not resolve the
 *   node twice.
 *
 * A node absent from the candidate list is still not pickable at all — the
 * honest spelling of `hitTestMode = "none"`, unchanged.
 *
 * §71's remaining strategy names collapse into these tiers rather than into
 * code of their own. **Analytic primitive testing** and **path geometry
 * testing** are the `"geometry"` tier fed with a shape's tessellation: a §50
 * circle's parameters reach picking as the triangles `toPath()` + the fill
 * tessellator already produce for drawing, so what draws is what picks —
 * §51's flattening tolerance included — through one exact code path instead
 * of a per-primitive zoo. **Ray/triangle intersection** is that tier's own
 * name. The **GPU identifier buffer** landed with RFC 0005 (2026-08-28) in
 * `@four/render` / `@four/render-webgl`, adapted by `four`'s
 * `createPickProvider`; **pixel-alpha testing** for CPU-resident texels is
 * {@link Pickable.alphaMask} (alternative D). **Custom callbacks** are the
 * one §71 strategy still absent, and `HitTestMode` deliberately omits
 * `"custom"` until they exist.
 *
 * ## Why the box test runs in local space
 *
 * A candidate's box is tested by transforming the **ray** into the node's local
 * space (through the inverse of its world matrix) rather than by transforming
 * the **box** into world space. The two are not equivalent:
 *
 * - Transforming eight corners and taking their world-space extent produces an
 *   axis-aligned box that *contains* the rotated box and is strictly larger
 *   whenever the rotation is not a multiple of a quarter turn — a thin bar
 *   rotated 45° inflates into a square with roughly half its area empty.
 *   Everything in that empty margin becomes a false hit.
 * - Transforming the ray instead tests the true **oriented** box. It is exact
 *   under any affine transform — rotation, non-uniform scale, shear from a
 *   parent — and it costs one matrix inversion per candidate instead of eight
 *   point transforms plus a min/max fold.
 *
 * It also makes the returned distance come out right for free. The local ray
 * direction is deliberately **not** re-normalized: writing the local ray as
 * `O_local + t · D_local` with `D_local = M⁻¹ · d_world`, applying `M` gives
 * `O_world + t · d_world`, so with a unit `d_world` the parameter `t` solved in
 * local space *is* the world-space distance, whatever the node's scale. No
 * correction factor, no second transform to measure with.
 *
 * ## Allocation (plan D7)
 *
 * Both entry points are allocation-free in the steady state: module-level
 * scratch for the ray and the inverse matrix, and hit objects pooled per `out`
 * array exactly as `@four/render`'s render list pools its items. Nothing here
 * is re-entrant — single-threaded input handling never calls user code
 * mid-pick.

/**
 * Writes the world-space picking ray through the normalized device coordinate
 * `(ndcX, ndcY)` into `outOrigin` and `outDirection` (§71).
 *
 * NDC runs `[-1, 1]` on both axes with **+Y up** (§7a), so `(-1, -1)` is the
 * bottom-left of the viewport and `(0, 0)` its centre; converting a pointer
 * position in CSS pixels into NDC is the pointer source's job (§72), not this
 * function's. The ray starts on the **near plane** and points into the scene,
 * `outDirection` normalized, and it is correct for both projections: a
 * perspective camera's rays fan out from the eye, an orthographic camera's are
 * all parallel and start at different places on the near plane.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const origin = new Vector3();
 * const direction = new Vector3();
 * createPickRay(camera, ndcX, ndcY, origin, direction);
 * ```
 *
 * The camera's **world matrix is resolved on demand**
 * (`resolveWorldTransform`), so a camera that has just moved — or that hangs
 * off a spring arm which has just moved — produces a correct ray without the
 * caller sequencing a resolve pass first. That walk is O(depth) and
 * version-cached, so on the normal path (the frame already resolved the scene)
 * it costs one comparison per ancestor.
 *
 * The camera's **projection is taken as-is**. `inverseProjectionMatrix` is
 * written by `Camera.updateProjectionMatrix`, which §47/WP-3.1 make explicit:
 * after changing a field like `aspect` on a resize, call it. Picking cannot do
 * that itself without guessing the `depthRange` the renderer used.
 *
 * `depthRange` (plan D8) says which clip-space depth convention that projection
 * was built with, and only affects **where along the ray the origin lands** —
 * the near plane's NDC depth is `-1` under `"negative-one-to-one"` and `0`
 * under `"zero-to-one"`. Passing the wrong one still yields the same ray
 * *line*, so hits are unaffected and only reported distances shift by a
 * constant; passing the right one makes them distances from the near plane. It
 * defaults to `"negative-one-to-one"` to match `updateProjectionMatrix`, so
 * WebGL 2 callers never pass it and WebGPU callers pass `"zero-to-one"`
 * (decision, WP-3a.1 — a camera does not store its depth range, because it
 * belongs to the renderer that draws the camera, and the same camera may feed
 * two backends).
 *
 * Allocates nothing. A degenerate projection (a zero-sized view volume,
 * `near === far`) leaves `outDirection` zero-length rather than `NaN`; see
 * {@link pick}, which treats such a ray as hitting nothing.

 *
 * Each candidate is tested in **its own local space** — the ray is transformed
 * by the inverse of the node's world matrix, so a rotated or non-uniformly
 * scaled box is tested exactly rather than as an inflated world-space AABB (see
 * the module header). World matrices are resolved on demand per candidate, so
 * the result is correct mid-frame without a preceding resolve pass.
 *
 * Every hit reports the **entry** point: the first intersection at or after the
 * ray origin. A ray that starts inside a box hits it at distance 0; a box
 * entirely behind the near plane is not hit at all. `out` is truncated to the
 * number of hits, so an empty array means nothing was picked.
 *
 * Skipped rather than reported, in both cases because no meaningful answer
 * exists: a candidate with an **empty or inverted** box (the `min = +Infinity`
 * convention of an empty geometry), and one whose world matrix is **singular**
 * (a zero scale somewhere up its chain), which cannot be inverted and describes
 * a node collapsed to nothing. A degenerate camera whose ray has no direction
 * yields no hits at all.
 *
 * `node.hitTestMode` selects each candidate's strategy — the module header
 * has the full table. In brief: `null` (the default) refines the box hit by
 * whatever the candidate carries; `"bounds"`, `"geometry"` and `"pixel"`
 * force one strategy, the latter two **throwing** `FourError`
 * (`INVALID_APPLICATION_STATE`, §85) when their box is hit but the candidate
 * carries no {@link Pickable.triangles} / {@link Pickable.alphaMask}; and a
 * `"gpu"` candidate is never tested here at all. A geometry-refined hit
 * reports the distance and point of the triangle actually under the pointer,
 * not the box entry.
 *
 * Allocation follows plan D7: pass `out` and the steady state allocates
 * nothing — the hits are pooled per array and rewritten in place, which is why
 * a hit (and its `point`) read after the next `pick` into the same array
 * describes a different intersection. Omitting `out` allocates a fresh array
 * for authoring convenience.
 *
 * `depthRange` is forwarded to {@link createPickRay}; see there.
