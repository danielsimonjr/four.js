/**
 * GPU-side textures for the WebGL 2 backend: one `WebGLTexture` per
 * `@four/render` `Texture`, cached and invalidated by version (§77, §61, §55).
 *
 * The twin of `gl-geometry.ts`, and deliberately so — same key (`id`), same
 * validator (`version`), same lazy eviction, same loss-aware
 * {@link TextureCache.forget}. Reading one module tells you how the other
 * behaves, and both back the same claim: **GPU residency is a backend cache, not
 * an application concern.**
 *
 * ## Why there is no `Renderer.createTexture` (decision, WP-3a.3)
 *
 * §61's interface declares `createTexture(source: TextureSource): Texture`, and
 * `@four/render`'s `renderer.ts` records it as a typed TODO. This packet leaves
 * it deferred and discovers textures from the render list instead: every sprite
 * item carries a `SpriteMaterial`, every sprite material names a texture, and
 * this cache uploads it the first time it is drawn.
 *
 * The alternative — a renderer-owned texture — would mean an application cannot
 * build a texture before it has a renderer, must build one per renderer, and
 * must re-create all of them by hand after a §61 context loss. None of that is
 * true of geometry today, and the geometry cache is the proof that it need not
 * be true of textures either. `createTexture` remains the right entry point for
 * the tier that has no CPU-side source to discover — render targets (§63),
 * compressed and GPU-only formats — and it lands with that tier. The deferral is
 * documented in `@four/render`'s `texture.ts` as well, on the class it concerns.
 *
 * ## What one entry holds
 *
 * A texture object and the version it was uploaded from. Sampler state — filter
 * and wrap — is set on the texture object at upload time and never changed, so
 * the per-draw cost in `webgl-renderer.ts` is one `bindTexture` and nothing
 * else. Mipmaps and anisotropy (R-30b, below) are more of the same state, set
 * in the same place, read by nothing on the draw path.
 *
 * ## Filter and wrap became the texture's own (R-30, 2026-08-13)
 *
 * This module fixed the pair at **`LINEAR` + `CLAMP_TO_EDGE`** until
 * 2026-08-13, and the note that stood here called that "the only combination
 * that is correct for a sprite or a glyph atlas". It is the right *default* and
 * it is not the only correct choice: a bitmap glyph atlas drawn at or above 1:1
 * wants `NEAREST`, because a 5 × 7 letterform blurred across its neighbours is
 * exactly the soft, dirty look bitmap text is accused of, and a tiling ground
 * texture wants `REPEAT`. So the four `texParameteri` arguments are now read off
 * `texture.filter` / `texture.wrap` (§77, `@four/render`'s `Texture`).
 *
 * **Byte-identity is structural, not numerical**: both fields resolve to the
 * previously hard-coded value when a source names neither, so a texture written
 * against any earlier build issues the same four calls with the same four
 * arguments in the same order. Nothing was added to the draw path — sampler
 * state is upload-time state, and the upload path is the one that grew two
 * table lookups.
 *
 * Because the state is written **at upload**, changing `filter` or `wrap` on a
 * texture already resident needs a version bump (`markDirty()`, or a new
 * `source`); the eviction rule below then re-uploads it with the new sampler
 * state, which is the same path an in-place texel edit takes.
 *
 * ## Mipmaps and anisotropy (R-30b, 2026-08-21)
 *
 * Three more upload-time decisions, and the same byte-identity claim, made
 * structurally rather than numerically:
 *
 * - `texture.mipmaps` adds **one** `generateMipmap` between the `texImage2D`
 *   and the sampler state — nothing for a texture that does not ask;
 * - the min filter is now `texture.minFilter` (which resolves to `filter` with
 *   no chain, so the two `texParameteri` calls stay the pair they were) while
 *   the mag filter is `texture.filter`, because magnification has no mip levels
 *   to choose between;
 * - `texture.anisotropy` above 1 adds **one** `texParameteri` after the wrap
 *   pair, and only after the device's ceiling has been resolved once
 *   ({@link TextureCache}'s private `#resolveAnisotropy`).
 *
 * So a texture naming none of the three issues the identical five calls in the
 * identical order it did on 2026-08-13, and a context that cannot generate
 * mipmaps at all degrades to a one-level upload with an in-level min filter
 * instead of leaving GL a texture it would sample as black.
 *
 * ## Eviction policy
 *
 * Identical to `GeometryCache`'s, for the identical reasons — see that module's
 * header for the full argument:
 *
 * - a **version bump** (an in-place texel edit plus `markDirty()`, or a new
 *   `source`) is detected on the next `acquire`, which deletes the stale texture
 *   and uploads a fresh one;
 * - **`texture.dispose()`** bumps the version and marks the texture disposed, so
 *   the next `acquire` deletes the GL object and returns `null` — the sprite is
 *   then skipped rather than drawn with undefined content (§83's "disposed
 *   resources still in use"). A texture disposed and never submitted again keeps
 *   its GL object until the renderer is disposed: the same documented leak
 *   window, with the same alternatives rejected for the same reasons;
 * - **context loss** is not eviction: {@link TextureCache.forget} drops the
 *   records without calling `deleteTexture`, because every handle is already
 *   invalid and the context must not be touched (§61).

   * *extension*: `anisotropy: 16` is a correct request that a conformant device
   * may be unable to fill, which is §62's capability tiering and not §85's
   * invalid value. The frame draws with the sharpness the device has. §85 still

   *
