/**
 * The node-material pipeline's registration slot (§60, §62; RFC 0001, gap
 * R-14) — the lazily-filled module `let` that keeps the GLSL emitter and the
 * program cache out of every bundle that never draws a node material.
 *
 * ## Why a registry slot, and why this module is nearly empty
 *
 * The pipeline-cost law (R-6; measured again by R-13, R-18 and RFC 0003):
 * anything `WebglRenderer` reaches statically rides in **every** bundle that
 * carries the class, at 0.75–1.9 kB gzip per compiled-at-init pipeline,
 * because nothing reachable from a class method tree-shakes. A GLSL emitter
 * is the largest module this backend has ever grown, so it lives in
 * `gl-node-program.ts`, which the renderer **never imports** — it imports
 * this module, whose whole content is one `let` and three functions. An
 * application opts in with
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { registerNodeMaterialPipeline } from "@four/render-webgl";
 * registerNodeMaterialPipeline();
 * ```
 *
 * which is what links the heavy module — the same shape as the §62 renderer
 * registry, the §37 solver registry, and RFC 0003's skinning slot, and the
 * move A-3 recorded as the rule: *a lazily-created module `let` only helps
 * when the thing that needs the feature is a module, not a value.* Here it is
 * a module.
 *
 * Even registration compiles nothing: the factory creates a **cache**, and a
 * program is compiled per distinct graph on the first draw (or §70 graph
 * effect) that needs it — never at initialize, so a scene with no node
 * material issues the byte-identical GL sequence it always did (RFC 0001's
 * acceptance gate, the F13 method).
 *
 * ## An unregistered node material is skipped, not drawn flat
 *
 * `WebglRenderer` resolves this slot on the first `"node"` item of a frame; a
 * `null` answer skips the draw with a one-time §85 development warning naming
 * the fix. Drawing flat instead was rejected by RFC 0001 §4: a graph the
 * author wrote is a specific picture, and drawing an unrelated one is R-6's
 * "a JSON value must not become a different picture" in the material domain.
