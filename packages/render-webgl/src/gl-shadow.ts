/**
 * The depth-only caster pipeline (§69) — this backend's seventh program (R-18,
 * 2026-08-09).
 *
 * §69 lists ten shadow features. **One tier ships**: a single directional
 * light's shadow map, rendered depth-only into an off-screen
 * `DEPTH_COMPONENT24` texture and sampled back with a 3×3 percentage-closer
 * filter. `@four/scene`'s `DirectionalLightShadow` owns the list of what is
 * staged and why; this module and `gl-program.ts`'s `SHADOW_GLSL` /
 * `ShadowUniforms` own how the shipped tier becomes GL.
 *
 * The split between the two files is `gl-standard.ts`'s: shared receiver-side
 * GLSL and its uniform helper sit beside the pipelines that splice them in,
 * and a pipeline of its own gets a file of its own.
 *
 * ## Why a seventh program and not a mode of an existing one
 *
 * A depth-only pass has no material, no lights, no uv, no normal, and no
 * colour. Drawing casters through the lit or unlit pipeline would mean
 * uploading uniforms nothing reads — per caster, per frame — and would make the
 * caster pass's GL sequence depend on which surface family the caster happens
 * to belong to. One program draws every caster instead, whatever shades it on
 * screen, and `gl-geometry.ts`'s vertex arrays serve it unchanged: position is
 * always at `POSITION_ATTRIBUTE_LOCATION`, and the streams this stage does not
 * declare are simply ignored.
 *
 * ## Determinism (§33)
 *
 * A shadow map is *scene rendering*, not simulation: the caster pass reads the
 * same resolved world matrices the colour pass reads, from the same render list
 * in the same order, and writes to a surface no simulation ever reads back. It
 * introduces **no new determinism hazard** — no time source, no RNG, no
 * readback, and no feedback into physics state (§43's rule is untouched,
 * because the pass consumes the very `item.worldMatrix` the view loop
 * consumes). What it adds is a second traversal of the frame's render list, in
 * that list's order, which is why the pass draws from the list rather than
 * re-walking the scene.
