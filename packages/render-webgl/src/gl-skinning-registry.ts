/**
 * The skinning pipeline's registration slot (§54, §62; RFC 0003, 2026-08-28)
 * — the lazily-filled module `let` that keeps two compiled programs and a
 * palette uploader out of every bundle that never skins.
 *
 * ## Why a registry slot, and why this module is nearly empty
 *
 * The pipeline-cost law (R-6, measured again by R-13 and R-18): anything
 * `WebglRenderer` reaches statically rides in **every** bundle that carries
 * the class, at 0.75–1.9 kB gzip per compiled-at-init pipeline, because
 * nothing reachable from a class method tree-shakes. Two skinned programs plus
 * their GLSL are more than that, so they live in `gl-skinning.ts`, which the
 * renderer **never imports** — it imports this module, whose whole content is
 * one `let` and three functions. An application opts in with
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { registerSkinningPipeline } from "@four/render-webgl";
 * registerSkinningPipeline();
 * ```
 *
 * which is what links the heavy module — the same shape as the §62 renderer
 * registry and the §37 solver registry, and the move A-3 recorded as the rule:
 * *a lazily-created module `let` only helps when the thing that needs the
 * feature is a module, not a value.* Here it is a module.
 *
 * ## An unregistered skinned draw is skipped, not drawn in bind pose
 *
 * `WebglRenderer` resolves this slot on the first skinned item of a frame; a
 * `null` answer skips the draw with a one-time §85 development warning naming
 * the fix. Drawing the bind pose instead was rejected by RFC 0003 §5: a
 * character standing in T-pose is a different picture, and the recorded rule
 * is that a value must not become one.
