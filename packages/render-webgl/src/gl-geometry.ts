/**
 * GPU-side geometry for the WebGL 2 backend: one vertex array per
 * `BufferGeometry`, cached and invalidated by version (§53, §61, §64).
 *
 * §53 gives every geometry a stable `id` and a `version` that advances on every
 * mutation the geometry can see, and states the contract this module is the
 * first consumer of: *"Backends cache GPU buffers per geometry. The cache key
 * is `BufferGeometry.version`."* So the cache is keyed by `id` and validated by
 * `version`. A dirty geometry with the same attribute/index presence reuses its
 * VAO and buffer objects, replacing each buffer's data store with `bufferData`.
 * Attribute additions/removals rebuild the record. `markDirty()` still uploads
 * every stream: the version does not say which array changed.
 *
 * ## What one entry holds
 *
 * A vertex array object plus the one to seven buffers it references —
 * positions, the optional normal stream (§68, 2026-08-04), the optional uv and
 * per-vertex colour streams (§53, R-19, 2026-08-07), the optional joint and
 * weight streams (§54, RFC 0003, 2026-08-28), the optional index
 * buffer — and the
 * three numbers the draw call needs (mode, element count, index type). Binding
 * a VAO restores the whole attribute *and* element-array binding state in one
 * call, so the per-draw cost in `webgl-renderer.ts` is `bindVertexArray` plus
 * `drawElements`/`drawArrays` — nothing else per object.
 *
 * Optional streams are uploaded **iff the geometry carries them**, at their own
 * fixed attribute locations, and every program ignores the slots it does not
 * declare. So a position-only geometry produces exactly the two GL calls it
 * always did, and a geometry that gained uvs costs one more buffer at upload
 * time and nothing per draw.
 *
 * The VAO is program-independent: the position stream is bound to the fixed
 * slot `POSITION_ATTRIBUTE_LOCATION`, which the shader declares with an
 * explicit `layout(location = ...)` (see `gl-program.ts`). A second pipeline
 * added later reuses these vertex arrays unchanged.
 *
 * ## Eviction policy (decision, WP-3.5)
 *
 * Entries are evicted **lazily, on the next acquire for the same geometry id**,
 * and eagerly for the whole cache on {@link GeometryCache.dispose}. There is no
 * background sweep and no finalization hook:
 *
 * - A **version bump** (in-place edit plus `markDirty()`, or an assignment
 *   through a setter) is detected on the next `acquire`. The fixed attribute
 *   layout survives changes to array length, index width, and primitive mode;
 *   only adding/removing an attribute or the index stream requires new handles.
 *   Data is always re-uploaded. Nothing is retained twice.
 * - **`geometry.dispose()`** bumps the version and empties the arrays (§53), so
 *   the next `acquire` deletes the stale GL objects and — finding nothing left
 *   to draw — returns `null` without creating a new entry. A geometry that is
 *   disposed and then *never submitted again* therefore keeps its GL objects
 *   until the renderer is disposed. That is a deliberate, documented leak
 *   window: the alternatives are a `FinalizationRegistry` (non-deterministic
 *   timing, which §33 makes unattractive even outside the simulation) or a
 *   disposal event on `BufferGeometry` (a subscription per geometry per
 *   backend, which §53 explicitly rejected in favour of the version counter).
 *   §83 puts resource ownership on whoever created the geometry; a renderer
 *   that is done with a scene disposes, and the scene's GPU memory goes with
 *   it.
 * - **Context loss** is not eviction: {@link GeometryCache.forget} drops the
 *   records *without* calling any `delete*` entry point, because every handle
 *   is already invalid and the context must not be touched (§61).
