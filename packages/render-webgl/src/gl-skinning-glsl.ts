/**
 * The vertex-stage skinning chunk both the colour/caster programs
 * (`gl-skinning.ts`) and the picking id program (`gl-picking.ts`) splice in.
 *
 * Isolated so {@link registerPickingPipeline} can draw a deformed silhouette
 * without linking `gl-skinning.ts` (pipeline-cost law: that module is the
 * `registerSkinningPipeline` seam). The two consumers interpolate the same
 * exported string; they must not drift.
 *
 * Linear blend skinning, four influences summed in attribute order — a
 * fixed association order, though the result never re-enters the §33
 * envelope either way. Dual-quaternion skinning is deferred (RFC 0003 §8).
 * Joint indices arrive as non-normalized `UNSIGNED_SHORT` floats at
 * location 4 and weights at location 5 (`gl-geometry.ts`).
