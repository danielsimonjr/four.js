/**
 * The batched particle pipeline for the WebGL 2 backend (§36, §64 stage 6,
 * §112; plan P9-3).
 *
 * One particle system is **one draw call**: `drawArraysInstanced` over the six
 * vertices of `@four/render`'s shared unit quad, with `count` instances fed from
 * a per-system dynamic vertex buffer that is re-uploaded once per frame. That is
 * what makes §112's "≥100 000 simple particles … rendered at interactive rates"
 * a question about fill rate rather than about draw-call overhead: the CPU cost
 * of drawing a system is a `bufferSubData` of `count × 32` bytes plus five GL
 * calls, whatever `count` is.
 *
 * Three things live here, grouped for the reason `gl-program.ts`'s header
 * gives:
 *
 * 1. **{@link ParticleGlContext}** — the WebGL 2 entry points *only* the
 *    particle path calls, layered on `WebglContext` (see "Why the context type
 *    is extended here" below).
 * 2. **{@link ParticleProgram}** — the pipeline: a screen-aligned quad
 *    billboarded in view space, coloured per instance, blended with straight
 *    alpha.
 * 3. **{@link ParticleBatchCache}** — one vertex array plus one dynamic
 *    instance buffer per particle system, keyed by the emitting node's id,
 *    invalidated and rebuilt exactly like `gl-geometry.ts`'s records.
 *
 * ## Points versus instanced quads (decision, WP-9.3)
 *
 * The cheaper-looking option is `gl.POINTS` with `gl_PointSize`: one vertex per
 * particle, no corner attribute, no instancing. It is **not** used, because the
 * largest point a rasterizer will draw is an implementation-defined limit
 * (`ALIASED_POINT_SIZE_RANGE`) that the specification does not floor at any
 * useful value, and a size past it is **silently clamped** rather than
 * reported — a particle that renders at the authored size on the developer's
 * GPU and at a different one on the user's, which is precisely the class of
 * defect a per-backend visual baseline (§92) cannot catch.
 *
 * **This packet did not measure that limit on SwiftShader**, the software
 * rasterizer the project's browser gate runs against: no browser run was in
 * scope for WP-9.3. That is the honest reason to avoid the mechanism rather
 * than to bet on it (reported to the orchestrator). Instanced quads have no
 * such cap, size correctly under any projection, and cost one extra 72-byte
 * vertex buffer for the entire application.
 *
 * `drawArraysInstanced` and `vertexAttribDivisor` are **core WebGL 2** — the
 * functionality WebGL 1 had to reach for `ANGLE_instanced_arrays` to get — so no
 * extension is queried and none can be missing: a context that lacks them is not
 * a WebGL 2 context, which is precisely what `webgl-renderer.ts`'s structural
 * check already rejects.
 *
 * ## Why the context type is extended here, not in `gl-program.ts`
 *
 * `WebglContext` is that module's written-down GL budget, and the particle path
 * needs three entry points outside it: `bufferSubData`, `vertexAttribDivisor`,
 * and `drawArraysInstanced`. They belong in `WebglContext` — but `gl-program.ts`
 * was outside this packet's file set (plan §1 rule 11: touch only your packet's
 * files), so they are declared as an **extension interface** the renderer
 * narrows to once, at initialization, through the same structural check that
 * accepts the context in the first place. The effect on a caller is nil: a real
 * `WebGL2RenderingContext` satisfies both, and the test fake implements both.
 * **Folding {@link ParticleGlContext} back into `WebglContext` is a mechanical
 * follow-up** (reported to the orchestrator) — it widens the exported
 * `WebglContext` contract, so it is not done as a drive-by.
 *
 * The program-building helpers this module once duplicated for the same reason
 * (`createLinkedProgram`, `requireUniform`, and the matrix scratch) were
 * consolidated back into `gl-program.ts` on 2026-08-05; the GL call sequences
 * and error messages are unchanged, as the fake-GL suite pins.
 *
 * ## Blending (§66, decision WP-9.3)
 *
 * Particles are transparent by construction — §36's colour ramp exists to fade
 * them out — so the particle pass runs with `GL_BLEND` **enabled**, and the
 * renderer turns it off again when the run ends, exactly as it does for sprites.
 * The blend *function* is the one this backend fixes once at initialization:
 * `SRC_ALPHA` / `ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA`, i.e. **straight (non-premultiplied)
 * alpha**, which is §66's stated policy for every colour this tier touches. The
 * per-instance RGBA is therefore used exactly as `@four/particles` authored it,
 * with no premultiply step anywhere.
 *
 * Two consequences, stated rather than hidden:
 *
 * - **Additive particles are staged.** Additive (`ONE`/`ONE`) is the other look
 *   §36 implies, and it needs per-material blend state from §57's `Material`
 *   base; a global switch here would apply to sprites too.
 * - **Depth writing stays on**, as it does for sprites, so overlapping systems
 *   composite in render-list order (layer, then `renderOrder`, then scene
 *   order). §66's transparency sorting is deferred with the same material state.
 *   Turning depth *writes* off for the particle pass would need `depthMask`,
 *   which is not in this backend's GL budget.
