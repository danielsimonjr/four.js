/**
 * §65 batching for the WebGL 2 backend — the GPU half of `@four/render`'s
 * {@link RenderBatcher} (R-9, 2026-08-09).
 *
 * `@four/render`'s planner decides *which* consecutive draws merge and produces
 * one interleaved vertex stream plus one index stream; this module owns the two
 * buffer objects and the vertex array those streams are uploaded into, and
 * issues the single `drawElements` that replaces them. Nothing here decides
 * what may batch — read `batch.ts`'s header for that, and for why the tier is
 * "consecutive items sharing a pipeline and a material instance".
 *
 * ```ts
 * const renderer = new WebglRenderer();
 * await renderer.initialize({ canvas });
 * renderer.batching = createGlBatching();     // §65, opt in
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why batching is opt-in (decision, R-9)
 *
 * §65 asks for batching to be "transparent to ordinary users". It is not
 * switched on for everybody here, and the reason is measured rather than
 * stylistic: **nothing reachable from a class method tree-shakes** (A-1, R-6,
 * R-13, R-18 — a compiled-at-init pipeline costs 0.75–1.9 kB gzip in every
 * bundle that carries `WebglRenderer`, whether the application uses it or not).
 * Three of this repository's six size budgets sit within 1 kB of their limit,
 * and a 2D application that draws twelve shapes gains nothing from a batcher.
 *
 * So the seam is the one this repository already uses for exactly this problem
 * (`registerRapierSolver`, `registerWebglRenderer`, `RendererRegistry`'s
 * lazily-created module `let`): **`WebglRenderer` never names anything in this
 * module at runtime.** It holds an interface-typed field, imported
 * `import type`, and calls methods through it. An application that never calls
 * {@link createGlBatching} does not link this module, does not link
 * `@four/render`'s planner, and pays **zero bytes** — measured, both ways.
 *
 * The transparency §65 asks for is then true of everything *above* the switch:
 * no node, material, geometry, render item or scene knows whether batching is
 * on, and turning it on changes no API. Making it the default is a one-line
 * change the day the build-time pipeline-selection seam A-4 records exists.
 *
 * ## What one draw becomes
 *
 * A batch draws through the **unlit program**, whatever pipeline its items
 * came from, because that program is the one whose shading is a product of
 * uniforms and interpolated vertex values:
 *
 * ```text
 * unlit  : fragColor = color [× vColor] [× texture(map, vUv)]
 * sprite : fragColor = texture(map, vUv) × tint
 * ```
 *
 * A sprite batch uploads the material's tint as `color`, switches `useMap` on
 * and `useVertexColors` off, and carries uv per vertex (which is exactly what
 * `render-list.ts` predicted §65 would need). The two expressions are then the
 * same product in the opposite order, and float multiplication is commutative,
 * so the fragment stage is **bit-identical** to the sprite pipeline's. The
 * vertex stage is not, and `batch.ts` says why: a batch has one model matrix,
 * so world transforms are baked on the CPU.
 *
 * Drawing through an existing program is also what keeps this cheap: no sixth
 * pipeline is compiled, no shader is edited, and the per-frame GL cost of a
 * batch is one `bufferSubData` pair, at most three `vertexAttribPointer`s, and
 * one `drawElements`.
 *
 * ## One vertex array per layout, specified once
 *
 * The interleaved layout depends on the material's §57 feature switches
 * (position, then uv iff the material samples, then colour iff it declares
 * `vertexColors`), so a frame that mixes sprite batches with vertex-coloured
 * shape batches uses two layouts. Attribute pointers are **vertex-array
 * state**, so rather than re-specifying one array per layout change, this
 * module keeps one array per layout — four at most, created on first use, over
 * the *same* two buffers. Switching layouts then costs one `bindVertexArray`
 * instead of up to five calls, and no attribute is ever left enabled over a
 * stride that no longer describes it, which is the failure mode a re-specified
 * array has to remember to avoid.
 *
 * ## Context loss (§61)
 *
 * The buffers and the vertex arrays belong to the context that created them.
 * {@link GlBatching.forget} drops the handles **without** calling `delete*`, as
 * every other cache in this backend does on loss, and the next draw recreates
 * them; {@link GlBatching.dispose} deletes them on a live context.
