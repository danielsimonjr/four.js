/**
 * GPU-side render targets for the WebGL 2 backend: one framebuffer object per
 * `@four/render` `RenderTarget`, cached and invalidated by version (§61, §48,
 * §63; R-4, 2026-08-07).
 *
 * The third member of the family `gl-geometry.ts` and `gl-texture.ts` started —
 * same key (`id`), same validator (`version`), same lazy eviction, same
 * loss-aware {@link RenderTargetCache.forget}, same "never throws inside
 * `render`" rule. Reading one module tells you how the other two behave, and
 * all three back the same claim: **GPU residency is a backend cache, not an
 * application concern.** That is also the answer to why §61's
 * `createRenderTarget` stays deferred; the argument is written out on
 * `@four/render`'s `RenderTarget`, on the class it concerns.
 *
 * ## What one entry holds
 *
 * A framebuffer, the colour texture attached to it, and — unless the target was
 * built with `depth: false` — a depth attachment: a renderbuffer by default, or
 * a `DEPTH_COMPONENT24` **texture** when the target asked for the samplable
 * form (R-18, §69's shadow maps). Plus the size the three
 * were allocated at, because that is what the renderer resolves a normalized
 * viewport rectangle against: reading it off the *record* rather than off the
 * `RenderTarget` guarantees the `viewport` call and the allocation agree even
 * if the application resized the target after this frame began.
 *
 * The colour texture gets the same fixed sampler state every MVP-tier texture
 * gets — `LINEAR` filtering, `CLAMP_TO_EDGE` wrapping (`gl-texture.ts`) — so a
 * material sampling a target needs no special case anywhere in the draw path.
 * `texImage2D` with `null` pixels allocates zero-filled storage, which is what
 * makes sampling a target that has never been rendered into read as transparent
 * black rather than as undefined content.
 *
 * ## Completeness is checked, not assumed (§85, §89)
 *
 * `checkFramebufferStatus` runs once per allocation. A framebuffer that is not
 * `FRAMEBUFFER_COMPLETE` — an unsupported attachment combination, a size past
 * the device's limits, a driver out of memory — is deleted immediately and
 * reported as `null`, and the renderer skips the frame. It is emphatically not
 * drawn into: an incomplete framebuffer turns every subsequent draw into a
 * `GL_INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION`, which is a silent, per-call error nobody
 * reads.
 *
 * ## Eviction policy
 *
 * Identical to the other two caches':
 *
 * - a **version bump** — `RenderTarget.resize()` — is detected on the next
 *   `acquire`, which deletes all three objects and allocates them at the new
 *   size. The old contents are gone; that is the documented behaviour of
 *   `resize`, not a limitation of this cache;
 * - **`target.dispose()`** bumps the version and marks the target disposed, so
 *   the next `acquire` deletes the GL objects and returns `null` — the pass is
 *   then skipped rather than drawn into a released framebuffer (§83's "disposed
 *   resources still in use"). A target disposed and never submitted again keeps
 *   its objects until the renderer is disposed: the same documented leak window
 *   `GeometryCache` and `TextureCache` carry, with the same alternatives
 *   rejected for the same reasons;
 * - **context loss** is not eviction: {@link RenderTargetCache.forget} drops the
 *   records without deleting anything, because every handle is already invalid
 *   and the context must not be touched (§61). The next frame re-allocates,
 *   which is §61's "re-creates engine-owned GPU resources … render targets" —
 *   done lazily, because the cache cannot know which targets the next frame
 *   will use.
 *
 * ## Staged (2026-08-07, R-4)
 *
 * The public shape of each of these is on `@four/render`'s `render-target.ts`;
 * what this module would additionally need is noted here:
 *
 * - ~~**Stencil attachments** (§67)~~ — **landed 2026-08-11 (R-7)**:
 *   `RenderTargetOptions.stencil` allocates the depth renderbuffer as packed
 *   `DEPTH24_STENCIL8` and attaches it to `DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT`. The
 *   interplay with R-18's samplable depth is an exclusion rather than a
 *   precedence: a framebuffer has one depth attachment, the packed form is a
 *   renderbuffer and the samplable form is a `DEPTH_COMPONENT24` texture, so
 *   `@four/render`'s constructor refuses `{ stencil: true, depthTexture: true }`
 *   (§85) and this cache never has to choose. `stencil: true` with
 *   `depth: false` is refused there too, because the stencil arrives *inside*
 *   the depth attachment.
 * - **Multiple render targets** (§63, §70) — a colour attachment per output
 *   plus `drawBuffers`, which is a new `WebglContext` entry point.
 * - **Multisampling** (§62) — `renderbufferStorageMultisample` into a
 *   colour *renderbuffer*, plus `blitFramebuffer` into a resolve texture, plus
 *   a `MAX_SAMPLES` query. Three entry points and a second framebuffer per
 *   target; deliberately not paid for by the minimal tier.
 * - ~~**`readPixels`**~~ (§61, §92) — **landed 2026-08-29**: `Rectangle2`
 *   arrived in `@four/math` and `WebglRenderer.readPixels(target, region?)`
 *   reads a cached target's framebuffer through the optional `readPixels`
 *   entry point (the stalling form, wrapped in §61's promise shape — the
 *   method's own doc defends the choice against the picking fence path).
