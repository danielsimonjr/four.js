/**
 * Debug-draw data providers (§113, plan P10-3) — the diagnostic visualization
 * list, shipped as **data**.
 *
 * §113 asks Phase 10 for "collision visualization; constraint visualization;
 * center-of-mass display; velocity and force vectors; solver statistics". This
 * module produces exactly those, in the only form `@four/diagnostics` is allowed
 * to produce them: a line list of world-space segments in a growable
 * `Float32Array` ({@link DebugDrawBuffer}), filled by small provider functions
 * that read a solver through **duck-typed seams**, plus statistics as plain
 * records. Nothing here draws anything, opens a context, or knows what a
 * renderer is.
 *
 * ## The render-integration verdict (decision, WP-10.3 — reported)
 *
 * The packet asked whether the overlay MVP needs a new render item kind or
 * whether existing unlit geometry honestly serves. Verified against the tree:
 *
 * - `packages/geometry/src/buffer-geometry.ts` — `GeometryDrawMode` is
 *   `"triangles" | "lines"`, and its own comment says the MVP tier "draws filled
 *   shapes and debug/wire lines". `positions` is held **by reference** and
 *   in-place edits plus `markDirty()` are explicitly legal, so a per-frame line
 *   list costs one array write and one version bump — no reallocation.
 * - `packages/render-webgl/src/gl-geometry.ts` — `glMode()` maps `"lines"` to
 *   `GL.LINES` today, so a `"lines"` geometry already reaches the GPU.
 * - `packages/render/src/render-list.ts` — a `Renderable` carrying a `"lines"`
 *   `BufferGeometry` and an `UnlitMaterial` becomes an ordinary `"unlit"` item
 *   with no render-package change at all.
 *
 * So: **no new render item kind is needed, and none is added here.**
 *
 * ## Per-segment colour in one draw (R-35 closed, 2026-08-07)
 *
 * Until 2026-08-07 the verdict above carried a stated cost — **one colour per
 * draw** — because `BufferGeometry` had no colour attribute and `UnlitMaterial`
 * was one flat RGBA. R-19 landed `BufferGeometry.colors` and
 * `UnlitMaterial.vertexColors`, and `@four/render-webgl` uploads the colour
 * stream at a fixed attribute slot, so the whole overlay now draws in **one
 * call at any segment count**.
 *
 * The bridge is {@link debugDrawStreams} + {@link applyDebugDrawStreams}: they
 * de-interleave this buffer's seven-float vertices into the two contiguous
 * streams `BufferGeometry` wants, reusing the arrays whenever the segment count
 * holds. This package still emits **plain `Float32Array`s and never a
 * `BufferGeometry`** — the frozen §3.1 matrix gives `diagnostics` no `geometry`
 * edge — so the two-line assembly happens in the application; see
 * {@link debugDrawStreams} for it.
 *
 * The buffer always stored a colour per vertex, deliberately, so that this
 * upload would repack nothing when it arrived. It did. The older
 * one-draw-per-colour routes still work and are still the right answer when the
 * overlay's categories want separate materials or draw order:
 * {@link DebugDrawBuffer.writePositions} with one buffer per category, or
 * {@link DebugDrawBuffer.writePositionsForColor} to filter a mixed one.
 *
 * ## Buffer layout (decision, WP-10.3)
 *
 * A **line list**: every two vertices are one independent segment, matching
 * `GL.LINES` and `BufferGeometry`'s `"lines"` mode, so a segment can be appended
 * without touching its neighbours (a strip could not). Each vertex is
 * {@link DEBUG_VERTEX_FLOATS} = 7 floats, each segment
 * {@link DEBUG_SEGMENT_FLOATS} = 14:
 *
 * | Offset (floats) | Components | Meaning                                  |
 * | --------------: | ---------: | ---------------------------------------- |
 * | 0               | 3          | endpoint A `x, y, z`, **world space**    |
 * | 3               | 4          | endpoint A colour, straight RGBA         |
 * | 7               | 3          | endpoint B `x, y, z`, world space        |
 * | 10              | 4          | endpoint B colour, straight RGBA         |
 *
 * Both endpoints of a segment carry the same colour today, because every
 * `add*` method takes one colour. Storing it per vertex rather than per segment
 * is deliberate: it is the layout a vertex-coloured upload wants, so the future
 * render item repacks nothing, and gradient segments become possible without a
 * layout change.
 *
 * Positions are **world space** — the seam reads world transforms (§42
 * `"physics"` authority publishes world poses) and a contact point is world
 * space by §29's definition. A node drawing this buffer therefore wants an
 * identity world matrix.
 *
 * ## Allocation (plan D7, §7b)
 *
 * The backing store doubles from `initialCapacity` on overflow and **never
 * shrinks**, including across `clear()`, so a steady-state overlay allocates
 * nothing after the first few frames. The providers hold their scratch
 * `Vector3`/`Quaternion` at module scope and allocate no math objects at all
 * (the tests assert this with `constructionCount()` from `@four/math`). The one
 * honest caveat: iterating a caller-supplied `Iterable` costs whatever iterator
 * that container mints — an `Array` allocates one per `for…of` — which is the
 * caller's choice of container, not this module's.
 *
 * Module-scope scratch means the providers are **not reentrant**: a provider
 * must not be called from inside another provider's callback. They are called
 * from a debug overlay once per frame, and none of them invokes user code.
 *
 * ## Non-finite values are recorded, not rejected (decision, WP-10.3)
 *
 * The `add*` methods validate their *scalar options* (a size or a scale is a
 * programmer's input) but do **not** check the coordinates they store. A NaN
 * pose is precisely the defect §113 exists to capture, and a debug buffer that
 * threw on it would destroy the frame that shows the bug. `BufferGeometry`
 * validates finiteness (§85) when the positions are handed to it, which is the
 * right place for the loud failure — one step later, with the overlay data
 * still in hand.
 *
 * ## The seams (plan §6h/§6i pattern)
 *
 * `@four/diagnostics` may depend on `core`, `math`, and `scene` only; it cannot
 * import `@four/physics`. So, exactly as `recorder.ts` does for `ReplayTarget`
 * and `@four/render`'s `particles.ts` does for `ParticleDrawable`, the shapes
 * this module reads are **declared locally and satisfied structurally**:
 *
 * - {@link DebugBodyAccess} transcribes the five members of `SolverBodyAccess`
 *   this module uses, from `packages/physics/src/body-access.ts`;
 * - {@link DebugJointAccess} transcribes two members of `SolverJointAccess`
 *   from the same file;
 * - {@link DebugContactPoint} and {@link DebugCollisionEventLike} transcribe
 *   `ContactPoint` and the `contacts` field of `CollisionEvent` from
 *   `packages/physics/src/events.ts` (§29).
 *
 * Both are generic in the handle type because §37's handles are *unforgeable*
 * branded interfaces (`packages/physics/src/types.ts`): a test double cannot
 * mint one, so the seams never name a concrete handle. The honest cost is the
 * same one `particles.ts` and `recorder.ts` state: **nothing type-checks the two
 * declarations against each other**; a change to `SolverBodyAccess` fails this
 * package's *tests*, which mirror the members, not its build.
 *
 * ## What the seams cannot answer (staged, 2026-08-02)
 *
 * Two items of §113's list are not obtainable through the seams as they exist,
 * and are staged with a dated note rather than approximated: constraint (joint
 * anchor) visualization and applied force vectors. See
 * {@link DEBUG_DRAW_STAGED} for the per-item reason, what ships instead, and
 * what would unblock each. Centre-of-mass display was staged with them and
 * unstaged 2026-08-04, when `SolverBodyAccess` grew `getBodyCenterOfMass` —
 * it ships as {@link collectCentersOfMass}.

 *
 * ## Why this returns arrays and not a `BufferGeometry` (decision, R-35)
 *
 * The §3.1 dependency matrix gives `@four/diagnostics` exactly three edges —
 * `core`, `math`, `scene` — and `geometry` is not among them; the matrix is
 * frozen, so this package cannot import `BufferGeometry` and must not pretend
 * to. What it can do is emit the two arrays in the exact shape `BufferGeometry`
 * accepts **verbatim**, which is the same duck-typed-contract move
 * `ParticleDrawable` and `ReplayTarget` make. The assembly is two lines in the
 * application, which owns both packages:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // once
 * const streams = debugDrawStreams(buffer);
 * const geometry = new BufferGeometry({ ...streams, mode: "lines" });
 * const node = new Renderable(geometry, new UnlitMaterial({ vertexColors: true }));
 *
 * // per frame
 * buffer.clear();
 * collectContactPoints(world.queuedEvents, buffer);
 * debugDrawStreams(buffer, streams);        // pack (no alloc at a stable count)
 * applyDebugDrawStreams(streams, geometry); // re-point or markDirty
 * ```
 *
 * The `{ ...streams, mode: "lines" }` spread works because
 * {@link DebugDrawStreams}'s first two fields are named exactly as
 * `BufferGeometryOptions`' `positions` and `colors`; the extra count fields are
 * ignored by the constructor. That naming is deliberate and load-bearing.
 *
 * ## Reuse (§7b out-parameter discipline)
 *
 * Pass the record back as `out` and the arrays are **rewritten in place**
 * whenever the segment count is unchanged — the steady state of an overlay
 * whose provider set is fixed, where this allocates nothing at all. When the
 * count moves, the two arrays are replaced (they must be: `BufferGeometry`
 * rejects a slack tail) and {@link DebugDrawStreams.resized} says so.
 *
 * Growing-and-never-shrinking, {@link DebugDrawBuffer}'s own policy, is
 * deliberately **not** copied here: an oversized array is exactly what the
 * geometry refuses, and re-pointing a geometry costs a full §85 validation scan
 * of both streams anyway, which dwarfs the allocation it would save.
 *
 * An empty buffer yields two zero-length arrays — a legal, empty `"lines"`
 * geometry that draws nothing, so an overlay with nothing to say needs no
 * special case.
 *
 * @param buffer the source; only its live segments are read
 * @param out a record from a previous call, to reuse
 * @returns `out` when given, otherwise a fresh record
