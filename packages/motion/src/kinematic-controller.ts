/**
 * Kinematic motion (§12) — the {@link KinematicController} component and the
 * {@link KinematicSystem} that advances it (§39 step 4).
 *
 * §12 defines the controller as a command surface:
 *
 * ```ts
 * interface KinematicController {
 *   moveTo(position: Vector3, options?: MoveOptions): void;
 *   rotateTo(rotation: Quaternion, options?: RotateOptions): void;
 *   followPath(path: Curve, options?: PathFollowOptions): void;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * "Kinematic controllers directly prescribe movement": nothing here integrates
 * forces or velocities — a command states where the node will be as a function
 * of time, and each fixed step evaluates that function and writes the result.
 * That is the whole difference from `MotionComponent` (§11), which derives
 * position from velocity, and from a solver (§37), which derives it from
 * forces.
 *
 * WP-2.5 implements the three methods above; §12's remaining required features
 * (steering behaviours, look-at constraints, orbit motion, camera rigs,
 * character controllers, motion limits) arrive with the Phase 8 advanced-motion
 * packets (§111). `followPath` takes the §13 {@link Trajectory} — the codebase
 * has no `Curve` type, and §13's sampler *is* the path abstraction §12 names
 * (decision, WP-2.5).
 *
 * ## Channels (decision, WP-2.5)
 *
 * A controller owns two independent command channels:
 *
 * | channel     | commands                    | writes                |
 * | ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
 * | translation | `moveTo`, `followPath`      | `transform.position`  |
 * | rotation    | `rotateTo`                  | `transform.rotation`  |
 *
 * Issuing a command **replaces the active command of its own channel** and
 * leaves the other channel untouched, so `moveTo` and `rotateTo` compose (a
 * node can slide and turn at once) while `followPath` **claims the translation
 * channel** and therefore cancels an in-flight `moveTo` — and is cancelled by
 * the next one. Two commands cannot share a channel: the last one issued wins,
 * immediately and without a warning, because "replace the goal" is the normal
 * way to steer a kinematic object.
 *
 * `followPath` writes position only. Aligning a node's facing to its path is a
 * §12 look-at constraint, i.e. a separate feature that would claim the rotation
 * channel; it is deliberately not folded into path following here.
 *
 * ## Where a move starts, and when that is decided (decision, WP-2.5)
 *
 * `moveTo`/`rotateTo` interpolate from the node's pose **at command start** to
 * the target. That pose is captured **lazily, on the first fixed step after the
 * command is issued** — not inside `moveTo` — because commands are issued from
 * application code, which runs *between* fixed steps (§10: the loop is
 * accumulator-driven, and `update` code is not synchronous with `fixedUpdate`).
 * Code that issues a command and then moves the node itself, or issues one from
 * an event handler that runs before some other system's write, would otherwise
 * interpolate from a pose the node no longer has, producing a visible jump on
 * the first step. Capturing at the first step makes "start from wherever the
 * node actually is when the move begins" true by construction.
 *
 * A consequence worth stating: replacing a command mid-flight restarts from the
 * node's *current* pose, which is where the previous command had reached. Moves
 * therefore chain without discontinuity, and a replaced move never rewinds.
 *
 * ## Timing
 *
 * Each channel accumulates its own elapsed time from
 * `TimeState.fixedDeltaTime` — the injected simulation clock, never a wall
 * clock (§33, ground rule 5). The first processed step already advances the
 * command by one `dt`, so a one-second move at 60 Hz is complete after exactly
 * 60 steps rather than 61, and is at its midpoint after 30.
 *
 * Completion is tested with a **relative tolerance**,
 * {@link KINEMATIC_COMPLETION_TOLERANCE}: summing `duration / dt` floating
 * point deltas does not land exactly on `duration` (60 × 1/60 overshoots by
 * 1.3e-15, 120 × 1/120 undershoots by 1.1e-15), and an exact `>=` test would
 * make "arrives at `duration`" depend on which way the rounding happened to
 * fall. 1e-9 of the duration is far below anything observable — a nanosecond of
 * simulated time on a one-second move — and far above the accumulation error
 * for any sane duration. A command that does trip the tolerance early is not
 * approximate: the completing step **snaps to the exact target**
 * (`position.set(target)`, `rotation.copy(target)`), so a move always finishes
 * *on* its target rather than one lerp step short of it.
 *
 * `duration` defaults to `0`, which means "snap on the next fixed step" — the
 * command still takes effect through the system, under the §42 authority check,
 * one step later; it is not a synchronous teleport.
 *
 * ## Completion is polled, not announced (decision, WP-2.5)
 *
 * Commands emit no events. Components are not `EventEmitter`s (§6b puts the
 * emitter on nodes and the application), and inventing a per-component event
 * surface here would pre-empt that design. The observable state is instead
 * three readonly properties — {@link KinematicController.translationActive},
 * {@link KinematicController.rotationActive}, and
 * {@link KinematicController.commandGeneration} — which cover the two questions
 * callers actually ask: "is it there yet?" and "is *my* command still the one
 * running?" (capture the generation when you issue, compare later; a different
 * value means something else took the channel). A `completed` node event can be
 * added later without changing any of this.
 *
 * ## Transform authority (§42)
 *
 * {@link KinematicSystem} writes as the `"kinematic"` authority, exactly like
 * `MotionSystem`, and refuses to write a node owned by anything else — warning
 * once per node through `warnAuthorityConflict` (§42: the owner keeps the
 * transform). A refused node's command is **frozen, not consumed**: its elapsed
 * time does not advance while the write is refused, so granting authority later
 * runs the command from where it stopped for its full remaining duration rather
 * than teleporting it to wherever it "should" have got to. This mirrors WP-2.3's
 * decision for `MotionComponent`, for the same reason: a refusal must be
 * visible and reversible, never silently accrued.
 *
 * An **idle** controller never warns. §42's rule is about *writing* a transform
 * you do not own, and a controller with no active command does not write; a
 * node that is merely equipped with a controller therefore stays quiet until
 * something actually commands it (decision, WP-2.5). A disabled node (§6
 * `enabled`) is skipped before the check, and its commands freeze too.
 *
 * ## Allocation (plan D7)
 *
 * A controller allocates its scratch vectors and quaternions once, in its
 * constructor; issuing a command copies into them and stepping writes through
 * them. Nothing on the per-step path allocates, including path following, which
 * samples the trajectory with an `out` vector. `moveTo`/`rotateTo` **copy**
 * their targets, so the caller keeps ownership of the vector it passed and may
 * mutate or reuse it immediately. `followPath` keeps a **reference** to the
 * trajectory (§13 trajectories are pure functions of time — copying one is not
 * meaningful), so a trajectory must not be mutated while it is being followed.
