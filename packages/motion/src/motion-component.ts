/**
 * `MotionComponent` (§11) and the system that advances it (§39 step 4).
 *
 * §11 defines the component verbatim as
 *
 * ```ts
 * interface MotionComponent {
 *   linearVelocity: Vector3;
 *   angularVelocity: Vector3;
 *   linearAcceleration: Vector3;
 *   angularAcceleration: Vector3;
 *   damping: number;
 *   angularDamping: number;
 *   maxSpeed?: number;
 *   maxAngularSpeed?: number;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * It is "non-physics procedural motion and a bridge to physics solvers": state
 * only, no behaviour. The behaviour is {@link MotionSystem}, registered with the
 * §39 {@link SystemRegistry} at the kinematic-motion slot (plan D5 — features
 * register systems, nothing edits the scheduler).
 *
 * ## The update (pinned by WP-2.2, semi-implicit Euler per §38)
 *
 * Per fixed step, per tracked node, linear and angular parts alike:
 *
 * ```text
 * v += a · dt                  // acceleration
 * v *= 1 / (1 + damping · dt)  // damping
 * clamp |v| to maxSpeed        // speed limit
 * x += v · dt                  // integrate with the *new* velocity
 * ```
 *
 * This is {@link semiImplicitEuler} with damping and the speed clamp inserted
 * between the velocity and position half-updates, which is why the system does
 * not call the integrator: neither operation is expressible through the
 * `acceleration` callback (damping written as a force would be integrated
 * explicitly and could overshoot past zero for `damping · dt > 1`, and a clamp
 * is not a force at all). The closed form of the damping factor after `n` steps
 * is `1 / (1 + damping · dt)ⁿ`, which `tests/motion-component.test.ts` asserts.
 *
 * `damping` and `angularDamping` are per-second rate coefficients and must be
 * `>= 0`; `maxSpeed` and `maxAngularSpeed`, when set, must be `>= 0`. Neither is
 * validated on this per-step path — a negative damping of exactly `-1 / dt`
 * divides by zero, and a negative speed limit reverses the velocity.
 *
 * ## Angular velocity (decision, WP-2.2)
 *
 * `angularVelocity` is an axis-angle rate vector in **radians per second**
 * (§7a): its direction is the rotation axis and its magnitude the rate about
 * that axis, right-handed. Per step the system builds the delta rotation
 * `q = axisAngle(ω̂, |ω| · dt)` and **premultiplies**:
 *
 * ```text
 * rotation = q · rotation
 * ```
 *
 * Premultiplication means ω is expressed in the node's **parent** frame (the
 * frame its local transform is written in), not in its own body frame — the
 * same convention as a physics solver's world-space angular velocity, which
 * matters because §11 calls this component "a bridge to physics solvers". When
 * `|ω| = 0` the rotation is left untouched (no `setFromAxisAngle` call, no
 * version bump). The product is renormalized on scratch storage before being
 * written back, so thousands of steps cannot drift off the unit sphere.
 *
 * Nothing here is a small-angle approximation: one step of `ω = (0, π/2, 0)` at
 * 60 Hz is an exact rotation of `π/120` about +Y, and 60 of them compose to
 * exactly `π/2` because rotations about a fixed axis commute.
 *
 * ## Which nodes the system advances (decision, WP-2.2)
 *
 * Explicit registration: {@link MotionSystem.track} adds a node, and the system
 * looks its `MotionComponent` up each step. The alternative — traversing a
 * scene subtree every fixed step and testing every node for the component — was
 * rejected: it makes the cost of motion proportional to total scene size rather
 * than to the number of moving objects, and it forces the motion system to know
 * about a root node it otherwise has no reason to hold. Consequences:
 *
 * - The set is a `Set<Node>` iterated in **insertion order**, so the update
 *   order is deterministic and reproducible (§33, ground rule 5).
 * - Attaching or removing the component via `node.addComponent` /
 *   `node.removeComponent` takes effect immediately without re-tracking,
 *   because the lookup happens per step; a tracked node with no component is
 *   skipped. That is what makes "add/remove via `Node`" work.
 * - A node with `enabled === false` is skipped (§6: `enabled` is "whether this
 *   node participates in simulation").
 * - Tracking is not automatic on `addComponent`: a component cannot see which
 *   system, if any, should own it. Track the node when you add the component.
 * - Mutating the tracked set *during* a fixed step follows `Set` iteration
 *   semantics — an untracked node is skipped, a newly tracked node runs in the
 *   same step. (Snapshotting the set to defer both, as the §39 registry does
 *   for systems, would allocate every step.) Track and untrack outside the step
 *   if that distinction matters.
 *
 * ## Transform writes
 *
 * Position and rotation are written through the math *methods* `set` and
 * `copy`, so plan D3's change hooks fire and `Transform.version` advances
 * exactly once each per moved node per step. Nothing is written when a node is
 * skipped, and a node with zero velocity still bumps its version (the write is
 * unconditional — testing for a zero delta would cost more than the write).
 *
 * Transform authority (§42) is not checked here yet: the authority field and the
 * conflict warning arrive with WP-2.3, whose enforcement hooks into this file.
