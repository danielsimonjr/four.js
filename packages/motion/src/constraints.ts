/**
 * §12's look-at constraint and the §39 step-7 system that runs it, together
 * with the §44 rigs (R-36 rig half + PH-11, 2026-08-13).
 *
 * §12 lists "look-at constraints" among the kinematic features and §42 names
 * `"constraint"` as one of the seven transform authorities. Until this module
 * nothing in the engine ever wrote under that authority: it was a legal value
 * with no producer, so a node declared `"constraint"` was a node nothing drove.
 * {@link ConstraintSystem} is that producer — the first one — and
 * {@link LookAtConstraint} is the aim it runs.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const camera = new PerspectiveCamera({ aspect });
 * camera.addComponent(new OrbitRig({ target: player, distance: 6 }));
 * camera.addComponent(new LookAtConstraint({ target: player }));
 * camera.transformAuthority = "constraint";      // §42 — required
 *
 * const constraints = new ConstraintSystem();
 * registry.register(constraints);
 * constraints.track(camera);
 * ```
 *
 * ## One system, one authority (§42)
 *
 * Placement (`OrbitRig`, `FollowRig`) and aim (`LookAtConstraint`) are three
 * components but **one** system, because §42 allows exactly one owner per node
 * and these three all write the same node's transform. Splitting them across
 * two systems would mean two writers claiming `"constraint"` over one node,
 * which §42's check cannot catch — it compares the *authority*, not the system
 * instance. Within the step the order is fixed and meaningful:
 *
 * 1. place — `OrbitRig`, then `FollowRig`;
 * 2. aim — `LookAtConstraint`.
 *
 * so the aim reads the pose written this step rather than last step's, and an
 * orbiting, aimed camera is exact on the first step rather than one frame
 * behind. (Attaching both rigs to one node is legal and the follow rig wins,
 * being second; they are alternatives, not layers.)
 *
 * §39's step 7 — `PRIORITY_CONSTRAINTS`, 700 — is where the registry runs it:
 * after the solve (600), so a rig following a rigid body sees the pose the
 * solver just wrote, and before the snapshot (1000), so §43's interpolation
 * carries the constrained pose rather than the pre-constraint one.
 *
 * ## Degenerate aims are counted, not thrown and not warned (decision)
 *
 * `Node.lookAt` **throws** on a degenerate aim (§85): a target that coincides
 * with the node, or an `up` parallel to it. That is right for authoring — the
 * mistake is in the call — and wrong inside a fixed step, where the same
 * configuration is reached for one frame by a camera whose target flew through
 * it. So {@link LookAtConstraint} makes `lookAt`'s two tests **itself, before
 * calling it**, and on failure leaves the rotation untouched and bumps a public
 * {@link LookAtConstraint.skippedSteps}.
 *
 * A counter rather than a warning, because a per-step `console.warn` is sixty
 * lines a second, and rather than silence, because a camera that quietly
 * stopped aiming is otherwise indistinguishable from one whose target stopped
 * moving. Refused-authority steps are deliberately *not* counted there: a rig
 * that is being refused by §42 has `skippedSteps === 0` and one warning, a rig
 * that is aiming at itself has no warning and a rising counter, and the two
 * states are worth telling apart.
 *
 * ## Determinism (§33)
 *
 * Tracked nodes are held in a `Set` and iterated in **insertion order**; the
 * per-step path reads its `deltaSeconds` from the injected `TimeState`, calls no
 * clock, allocates nothing, and reaches `Math.acos`/`Math.sin`/`Math.sqrt` —
 * same-runtime tier, like the rest of the engine's floating point.

 * §12's look-at constraint: a component that turns its node's `−Z` axis towards
 * a target every fixed step, optionally rate-limited.
 *
 * The aim itself is `Node.lookAt` — the same primitive an application calls, so
 * a constrained camera and a hand-aimed one agree exactly (R-36). What this
 * component adds is the three things a *per-step* aim needs and a one-off call
 * does not: a target that may be a moving node, a survivable answer to the
 * degenerate configurations `lookAt` refuses, and a slew limit.
 *
 * ## The slew limit
 *
 * With `maxAngularSpeed` set, the node turns towards the aim at no more than
 * that many radians per second, along the **shortest arc** (`Quaternion.slerp`'s
 * rule), and never overshoots: a rig that is `θ` radians off arrives in
 * `θ / maxAngularSpeed` seconds and stops there, because the goal is recomputed
 * from the target every step rather than integrated.
 *
 * It is implemented by writing the rotation **twice** on a limited step — once
 * by `lookAt`, which lands on the goal, then once by slerping back from the
 * rotation captured before the call. That is deliberate. The alternative is a
 * second copy of `lookAt`'s world-rotation-to-local-rotation division, which is
 * the one piece of that method with a real subtlety in it (the parent's world
 * rotation, recovered by decomposition), and two copies of it would be two
 * things to keep in agreement. Two writes cost one extra `Transform.version`
 * bump on a step that was already recomputing a world matrix.
