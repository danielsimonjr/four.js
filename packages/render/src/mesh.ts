/**
 * `Mesh` (§54) — the renderable that can be skinned (RFC 0003 — gaps PH-10 +
 * R-22, 2026-08-28).
 *
 * §54 declares `class Mesh extends Renderable` with `geometry`, `skeleton`,
 * and `morphTargetWeights`, and this module is where the class finally lands —
 * it is "the carrier for everything else" in RFC 0003's row table. What each
 * §54 field resolves to here:
 *
 * - **`geometry`** is inherited: `Renderable` already owns the field, and a
 *   mesh's skin influences are the geometry's own `joints`/`weights`
 *   attributes (§53; `@four/geometry`).
 * - **`skeleton`** is this class's field, validated at assignment — see
 *   {@link Mesh.skeleton}.
 * - **`morphTargetWeights`** is an **accessor over the `MorphWeights`
 *   component** (`@four/scene`), not storage: §54's own placement was
 *   unimplementable under the frozen §3.1 matrix (`@four/animation` may never
 *   see this package), so the storage moved to a §6a component and the
 *   spelling here is kept as a getter — the amendment §54 records (spec
 *   revision 1.8; RFC 0003 §1c).
 *
 * ## Which §54 rows this class carries, and which stay staged (RFC 0003 §7)
 *
 * **Ships:** the class itself; skeletal deformation (through the skinned
 * render-item kinds and `@four/render-webgl`'s registered skinning pipeline);
 * the morph-target *plumbing* (component, §17 binding form, weights on the
 * render item). **Staged, deliberately:** the GPU morph path (morph targets
 * are additional vertex streams — a four-target mesh triples the attribute
 * budget, which is its own layout decision); multiple material groups (R-12's
 * follow-up — `material` stays single here as on `Renderable`); hardware
 * instancing (needs an instance-transform attribute; the blocker for §86's
 * 100 000-instance row); indirect rendering (WebGPU); static-versus-dynamic
 * GPU buffer usage (every geometry uploads `STATIC_DRAW` today); level of
 * detail, impostors, billboards, and the merging tools (ordinary packets).
 * CPU skinning, bone textures, and dual-quaternion skinning are likewise
 * deferred with reasons recorded in RFC 0003.
 *
 * ## Two known inaccuracies, entered deliberately (RFC 0003 §6)
 *
 * **No engine API returns skinned vertex positions** — the rule that keeps
 * vertex skinning outside the §33 envelope (the palette goes to the GPU;
 * nothing comes back; §33's checksum is over bodies, not vertices). Two
 * documented consequences, recorded at this type because this is where a user
 * meets them:
 *
 * - **§71 picking against a skinned mesh uses bind-pose bounds**, and is
 *   therefore wrong whenever the pose differs materially from bind
 *   (`@four/input`'s `pick.ts` already defers analytic picking; this is a
 *   second known inaccuracy of the same kind).
 * - **§87 frustum culling culls a skinned mesh by its bind-pose bounds**, so
 *   an animation that moves geometry outside them can pop; set
 *   `frustumCulled = false` on such a mesh, or wait for the authored
 *   bounds-expansion factor RFC 0003 names and defers. The same bind-pose
 *   caveat applies to a §67 `clip` on a skinned mesh (the mask is the
 *   bind-pose shape) and to the §69 caster pass, which skips skinned draws
 *   rather than casting a bind-pose shadow.

/**
 * The most bones one skinned draw may use — the declared §62 capability behind

 *
 * **48**, a portability floor rather than a device query, and the arithmetic
 * is the reason: the palette is `uniform mat4 jointMatrices[N]` in the vertex
 * stage, WebGL 2 guarantees only `MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_VECTORS ≥ 256` vec4s, a
 * mat4 is four of them, and the skinned programs' other uniforms (two
 * matrices, colours, §68's light set) need headroom — `48 × 4 = 192` vec4s
 * leaves 64 for everything else on the worst conformant device. A constant
 * rather than a `getParameter` read, deliberately: R-30b's recorded law binds
 * (*a capability query must be lazy if the alternative moves recorded
 * transcripts*), and a per-device limit is a negotiation the fixed-palette
 * tier does not need — the unbounded path is a bone **texture**, deferred
 * with its reasons in RFC 0003 (it needs the render-target format union
 * widened and vertex texture fetch checked per device).
 *
 * A `Skeleton` over more bones is refused **at setup** — {@link Mesh.skeleton}
 * throws `UNSUPPORTED_GPU_FEATURE` (§89) on assignment — following R-5/R-6's
 * setup-time validation stance (§61: a backend may not throw from inside a
 * frame). Splitting into per-palette submeshes and a CPU fallback are the
 * named, not-taken alternatives (RFC 0003 open question 5, adopted).
