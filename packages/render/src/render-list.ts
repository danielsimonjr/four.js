/**
 * Render-list construction (§64) — scene graph in, flat sorted draw list out.
 *
 * §64 requires the renderer pipeline to separate eight stages: traversal,
 * visibility and layer filtering, frustum and occlusion culling, render-item
 * generation, sorting, batching and instancing, backend command encoding, and
 * GPU submission. This module is stages **1, 2, 4, and 5** — the backend-
 * independent half — and produces "compact render items" exactly as §64 asks,
 * so the drawing hot path never makes a virtual call on a node.
 *
 * Two node kinds generate an item: §49's `Renderable` — which §55's `Sprite`
 * has been a subclass of since §57's `Material` base landed (2026-08-06) — and,
 * structurally and never by inheritance, a §36 particle system, which
 * contributes **one batched item for the whole system** (plan P9-3). The second
 * is a duck-typed contract because the frozen dependency matrix forbids an edge
 * in either direction (see `particles.ts`).
 *
 * Which pipeline a renderable draws through is read off its **material's**
 * `kind` (§57), not off the node's class: that is one property load, it is what
 * makes a family member a consumer writes reachable without editing this file,
 * and it is why the sprite no longer needs an `instanceof` of its own.
 *
 * Not here, and why:
 *
 * - **Culling (stage 3).** Frustum culling needs a camera, and this module has
 *   none: one list serves every view of the frame. It landed in `view-list.ts`
 *   as a **derivation** of this list per view (R-8, 2026-08-09) — see that
 *   module for why the frame builds one list and a view queries it rather than
 *   building its own. What this module contributes is the item's
 *   `frustumCulled` snapshot and, through `bounds.ts`, the world bounds §87
 *   asks for; every visible renderable is still generated here.
 * - **Batching (stage 6).** §65 is a whole packet, and batching decisions
 *   depend on the backend's pipeline model (WP-3.5). The one exception is a
 *   particle system, which arrives *already* batched: one item carrying every
 *   particle, because §112's 100 000-particle target is not reachable any other
 *   way (plan P9-3, WP-9.3).
 * - **Encoding and submission (stages 7–8).** Backend work by definition; the
 *   render list is the handover point, and it deliberately contains no GL
 *   objects.
 *
 * ## Ordering (§66 subset)
 *
 * §66's full order is: render layer, opaque versus transparent, pipeline and
 * material compatibility, depth, explicit render order. {@link buildRenderList}
 * sorts by **render layer, then opaque before transparent, then explicit render
 * order, then scene-graph order** — keys 1, 2, and 5.
 *
 * Key 3 (pipeline and material compatibility) ships as
 * {@link groupRenderListByPipeline} and key 4 (depth) as `view-list.ts`'s
 * `sortRenderListByDepth` — both **second verbs** rather than modes of the
 * builders:
 *
 * - key 3 cannot be the default order, and the reason is stronger than
 *   byte-identity (R-10, 2026-08-09). Grouping by pipeline permutes draws that
 *   were tied under keys 1, 2 and 5 — which, in this engine, is most of a 2D
 *   scene — and **co-planar opaque draws are order-dependent**: §61 fixes the
 *   depth function at `LEQUAL`, so of two surfaces at the same depth the one
 *   submitted *later* wins. That is not an accident to be fixed; it is what
 *   makes a §58 stroke paint over its own fill (R-16) and what makes a later
 *   sibling draw on top in every 2D scene. A default-on key 3 would therefore
 *   repaint existing scenes, not merely reorder their GL calls. §66 lists the
 *   key for content whose overlap is resolved by depth, and this engine's
 *   own 2D layer model is the case where that is untrue, so the key is offered
 *   and never imposed. See {@link groupRenderListByPipeline};
 * - key 4 needs a camera to measure distance along and a **per-view** list to
 *   store the measurement in, because one list serves every view of a frame: a
 *   depth key computed for one camera would order the others by the wrong
 *   number. R-8's per-view derivation supplied both on 2026-08-09, and the key
 *   ships there — on the derived list, never on this one. It is opt-in for key
 *   3's reason, unchanged: under `LEQUAL` a depth sort permutes co-planar
 *   opaque draws, and co-planar opaque draws are what a 2D scene is made of.
 *   See `view-list.ts`'s `sortRenderListByDepth`.
 *
 * Key 2 landed on 2026-08-06 with §57's `transparent` flag (`material.ts`).
 * It is a **no-op for every scene that does not use it**: with the base's
 * `transparent: false` default every item classifies opaque, the comparator
 * returns 0, and the stable sort leaves the list exactly as it was — which is
 * the property that let the key land under the pixel-golden gate. The sprite
 * and particle pipelines blend by construction but are *classified* by their
 * material's flag like everything else; reclassifying them wholesale is a
 * follow-up (2026-08-06), because it would reorder existing scenes.
 *
 * The tie-break is **scene-graph order** — the depth-first, insertion-ordered
 * walk of §6 — which makes the list a deterministic function of the scene (§33)
 * and gives authors the one ordering guarantee 2D content actually relies on:
 * later siblings draw on top. It comes for free from a stable sort, since items
 * are generated in traversal order.
 *
 * ## Allocation (plan D7)
 *
 * Both builders fill a caller-supplied `out` array and reuse **pooled item
 * objects** keyed to that array, so the steady state allocates nothing at all —
 * no items, no matrices, no `Vector3`/`Quaternion` scratch. The consequences
 * are stated on {@link buildRenderList} and matter: the items are valid until
 * the next build into the same array.

/**
 * Which pipeline a render item needs (§64 stage 7, §66 sort key 3).
 *
 * A backend cannot draw a textured quad with the flat-colour pipeline, so an
 * item has to say which one it is. The discriminant is carried **on the item**
 * rather than derived from the material's class at draw time, for the reason
 * §64 gives for compact render items in the first place: the draw path must not
 * make a virtual call, an `instanceof` check, or a property probe per object.
 * It is also the field §66's key 3 ("pipeline/material compatibility") will sort
 * on when batching (§65) lands (decision, WP-3a.3).
 *
 * A string union rather than an enum, matching `TransformAuthority`,
 * `RendererBackend`, and `GeometryDrawMode`: it serializes, logs, and compares
 * as itself.
 *
 * `"lit"` joined with the §68 lighting packet (2026-08-04): a `Renderable`
 * generates `"unlit"` or `"lit"` according to its material's own `kind`
 * discriminant (§57) — a material property, not a node property, because
 * which pipeline shades a surface is exactly what a material *is*.
 *
 * `"standard"` joined with §59's metallic-roughness workflow (R-13,
 * 2026-08-08), by the same rule and for the same reason. Widening this union is
 * still an edit to this package, which is R-12's remaining half: the closed
 * union is the **staging mechanism**, not the destination — it keeps every arm
 * type-checked end to end while the pipeline registry §64 asks for is designed
 * (see `pipelineOf`).
 *
 * `"skinned-unlit"` and `"skinned-lit"` joined with §54's skinning (RFC 0003,
 * 2026-08-28), and they are the one pair whose discriminant is **not** the
 * material's `kind` alone: a skinned draw is the same §57 material family
 * through a different *vertex* stage, so the kind is the material's family
 * crossed with "this node has an active skin" — a `Mesh` with a `Skeleton`
 * over a geometry carrying `joints`/`weights` (see `collect`). Skinning is a
 * separate pipeline rather than a uniform switch because `useMap`'s trade
 * inverts in the vertex stage: a `useSkinning` uniform would add four palette
 * fetches and a weighted sum to **every vertex of every draw** to serve the
 * rare skinned one (RFC 0003 §5, alternative B rejected).
 *
 * ## Note for RFC 0001 (which inherits this shape)
 *
 * RFC 0003 landed first, so this widened closed union — one string member per
 * compiled pipeline, discriminating the item union, with the backend's draw
 * loop switching on it — is the shape RFC 0001's `pipelineId` follow-up
 * refines rather than reinvents: a registry-issued pipeline id would replace
 * the *closed-ness* (a consumer material could bring its own arm), not the
 * discriminant-on-the-item design, and the two skinned members show what a
 * vertex-stage variant looks like in it (family × vertex path, decided at
 * item-generation time, never per draw). Until then, widening remains an edit
 * to this file, and an exhaustive consumer `switch` over `RenderItemKind` is
 * broken by every widening — the §90 note both RFCs record.
 *
 * `"node"` joined with §60's node materials (RFC 0001, 2026-08-28), and it is
 * the shape that note anticipated, implemented at the item tier: **one**
 * member discriminates the whole node-material family — decided at
 * item-generation time from the material's `kind`, like every other member —
 * while the *compiled-pipeline* identity inside that family is the graph's
 * structure, resolved by the backend's program cache off
 * `item.material.graph` (one program per distinct graph, however many
 * materials share it). The registry-issued `pipelineId` that would replace
 * this union's closed-ness therefore remains a follow-up; what §60 needed was
 * a member whose pipeline *count* is open while the member set stays closed.
 * An unregistered backend **skips** a `"node"` item with a one-time §85
 * warning — `pipelineOf`'s flat-colour fallback is deliberately excluded for
 * it, because a graph the author wrote is a specific picture and drawing an
 * unrelated one is R-6's "a JSON value must not become a different picture"
 * in the material domain.

/**
 * Re-sorts an already-built render list with §66's **sort key 3** — pipeline and
 * material compatibility — inserted between key 2 and key 5, in place, and
 * returns it (R-10, 2026-08-09).
 *
 * ```ts
 * buildRenderList(scene, list);       // keys 1, 2, 5 — the order every scene has
 * groupRenderListByPipeline(list);    // keys 1, 2, 3, 5 — draws grouped for §65
 * ```
 *
 * The point of key 3 is that a batcher can only merge draws that are already
 * **adjacent**: grouping is what turns an interleaved scene into runs
 * `@four/render-webgl`'s batcher can collapse (§65, R-9). A scene authored in
 * groups already — a thousand sprites parented to one node, sharing one atlas —
 * needs none of this, which is why the builders do not do it.
 *
 * ## Why this is a second verb and not a parameter (decision, R-10)
 *
 * Because the reordering is **not always safe**, and a default, a flag, or an
 * option would all put the unsafe case one keystroke from an author who never
 * read this paragraph:
 *
 * - §61 fixes the depth comparison at `LEQUAL`, so where two opaque surfaces
 *   sit at the same depth the one drawn *later* wins. All of this engine's 2D
 *   content sits at one depth. Grouping by material therefore **changes the
 *   picture** of a 2D scene, rather than only changing the order of its GL
 *   calls — a §58 fill and its stroke, two overlapping shapes, a sprite over a
 *   background quad.
 * - §66 lists key 3 for content whose overlap is resolved by the depth buffer.
 *   That is true of the 3D half of this engine and false of the 2D half, and no
 *   property of a render item distinguishes them.
 *
 * So the caller who knows their content is depth-resolved (or who is drawing
 * one flat layer of same-depth-independent sprites) asks for the grouping, and
 * everybody else keeps the order they have had since 2026-08-06 — byte for
 * byte, since {@link buildRenderList} is untouched by this function's existence.
 *
 * ## Stability
 *
 * `Array.prototype.sort` is stable (ES2019), so items that compare equal keep
 * their relative order — which, after {@link buildRenderList}, is scene-graph
 * order. Two consequences: sorting a list that is *already* grouped changes
 * nothing at all, and a scene where every item shares one pipeline and one
 * material is left exactly as it was.
 *
 * @param list a list produced by {@link buildRenderList} or
 * {@link buildInterpolatedRenderList}; sorted in place and returned, so the
 * pooled items and the caller's array are the same objects afterwards.

 *
 * **World matrices are not resolved here.** Each item's `worldMatrix` is a

 * already runs before its `render` listeners. Keeping resolution out of this
 * function is what lets the two passes stay separately schedulable (§64 lists
 * them as distinct stages) and what makes the item generation free.
 *
 * `out` is truncated to the number of items generated, so a list that shrinks
 * does not leave stale items behind. The items themselves are **pooled per
 * `out` array**: after a rebuild the array contains the same item *objects*,
 * with new contents and possibly in a new order. Two consequences worth
 * stating —
 *
 * 1. an item read after the next build into the same array describes a
 *    different draw; copy anything you need to keep;
 * 2. two independent lists need two `out` arrays (they then have independent
 *    pools), which is the normal way to render several viewports.

 * objects. The first few frames grow the pool to the scene's item count and

 * ## `layerMask` (§46, §64 stage 2; R-38, 2026-08-08)
 *
 * ```ts
 * buildRenderList(scene, list, camera.layers);   // only what this camera sees
 * ```
 *
 * Only nodes sharing a bit with `layerMask` generate items; their children are
 * traversed regardless, because §46 layers do not inherit (see `collect`). The
 * default is `ALL_LAYERS`, which makes the test true for every node whose mask
 * is non-zero — i.e. every node that has not been explicitly removed from all
 * layers — so a caller that omits it gets exactly the list it got before the
 * parameter existed, in exactly the same order.
 *
 * This is the **build-time** half of §46 filtering, for the caller that builds
 * one list per view. The other half is {@link RenderItem}'s `layers` snapshot,
 * which lets one shared list be filtered per view by `view-list.ts`'s
 * `buildViewRenderList`; the WebGL backend takes that route, because a frame
 * that traverses the scene once and derives per view is cheaper than one that
 * traverses per view (R-8).
 *
 * @throws FourError `INVALID_SCENE_GRAPH` **in a development build** when
 * `layerMask` is not an integer in `[0, 0xffffffff]` (§85) — a `NaN` mask would
 * otherwise empty the list with no diagnostic at all. §85 lets a production
 * build drop expensive validation, and this one costs bytes in every shipped
 * bundle for a mistake that is an authoring error by construction, so it is
 * gated: measured at ~115 B gzip on `ui-demo`, deleted entirely by
 * `__FOUR_DEV__: false` (R-38, 2026-08-08). The check itself,
 * `@four/scene`'s `assertLayerMask`, is unconditional there — `@four/scene` is a
 * §33 simulation package and may not branch on the build mode at all.

/**
 * Builds the sorted render list for `root`'s subtree into `out` using **§43
 * interpolated render poses** at `alpha`, and returns `out`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // per rendered frame, between fixed steps:
 * buildInterpolatedRenderList(scene, poses, time.interpolationAlpha, list);
 * ```
 *
 * Identical to {@link buildRenderList} in traversal, filtering, sorting, and
 * pooling; the one difference is each item's `worldMatrix`, which is a pooled
 * matrix holding the world transform composed from interpolated local poses
 * root-first (see `composeRenderPoseMatrix`) instead of a reference to
 * the node's resolved world matrix. This is §43's fix for rendering faster than
 * the simulation steps: at `alpha = 0` every item matches the previous captured
 * pose, at `alpha = 1` the current one, and in between position lerps and
 * rotation slerps. `alpha` is clamped to `[0, 1]` by `PoseBuffer`.
 *
 * Nodes the buffer does not track — static geometry, anything moved directly by
 * the application — contribute their **live local transform** at every alpha, so
 * a mixed scene needs no bookkeeping: track what the simulation moves, leave
 * the rest alone.
 *
 * Because the poses are composed into pooled matrices, this function **never
 * writes scene state** (§43: the render transform must not feed back into the
 * simulation). It also does not need `resolveWorldTransforms` to have run: it
 * derives every matrix itself, at `O(depth)` per item.
 *
 * `layerMask` filters exactly as it does for {@link buildRenderList} — same
 * default, same semantics, same development-only §85 check — and interacts with nothing else
 * here: a filtered node contributes no item, so no render pose is composed for
 * it either.
