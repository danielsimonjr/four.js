/**
 * `RenderGraph` (§63) — an ordered list of passes, executed by one call, with
 * the dependency between "a pass writes a target" and "a later pass samples it"
 * checked rather than assumed.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const scenePass = new RenderTarget({ width: 512, height: 512 });
 *
 * const graph = new RenderGraph();
 * graph.addPass("world", { root: scene, views: [mirrorView], target: scenePass });
 * graph.addPass("composite", { root: scene, views: [mainView] }, { inputs: ["world"] });
 *
 * // Once, at setup — and in tests:
 * expect(graph.validate()).toEqual([]);
 *
 * // Per frame, in place of the two `renderer.render` calls:
 * graph.execute(renderer, { poseBuffer: poses, alpha: time.interpolationAlpha });
 * ```
 *
 * ## What this tier is, and what it deliberately is not (decision, R-5, 2026-08-07)
 *
 * §63 asks for "a directed acyclic graph of passes and resources" managing
 * seven things: pass dependencies, transient render targets, resource lifetime,
 * barriers and state transitions, pass enable/disable, viewport-specific
 * pipelines, and debug visualization. This module ships the **linear-pass
 * tier**: the passes are an ordered list, each pass is exactly one
 * `renderer.render(root, views, interpolation, target)` call over R-4's seam,
 * and dependencies are *validated* against that order instead of being used to
 * derive it. Concretely:
 *
 * | §63 requirement                | this tier                                                              |
 * | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | pass dependencies              | **shipped** — declared `inputs`, plus the sampled-target check in {@link RenderGraph.validate} |
 * | pass enable/disable            | **shipped** — {@link RenderGraph.setPassEnabled}                        |
 * | viewport-specific pipelines    | **shipped** — every pass carries its own `views`                        |
 * | debug visualization            | **partial** — {@link RenderGraph.describe} is textual. §63 also wants the pass outputs *on screen*, which needed §70's full-screen blit; R-6 shipped it, so an on-screen view of any intermediate target is now one `{ kind: "effect", source, effect: COPY_EFFECT }` pass. Building that view — a viewport-tiled inspector — is this module's remaining follow-up, not a missing capability |
 * | transient render targets       | **staged** — targets are application-owned `RenderTarget`s passed in; a pool that allocates and aliases per frame needs a size/format key and a lifetime analysis this tier does not compute |
 * | resource lifetime              | **staged** — same reason; §83 disposal stays the application's           |
 * | barriers and state transitions | **staged** — WebGL 2 has no explicit barriers, so there is nothing for this tier to emit; the requirement is real for the WebGPU backend (§62) and lands with it |
 *
 * Two reasons the linear tier is the honest stopping point rather than a
 * shortcut. First, a topological sort over declared `inputs` would produce an
 * order the author cannot see, and §63's own example is already written in
 * execution order — so the sort would buy reordering nobody asked for and cost
 * the property that "the graph does what the list says". Second, transient
 * targets and barriers are both *backend* facts (a pool needs the allocator, a
 * barrier needs an API that has them), and this package is backend-free by
 * §98's assignment; building them here would mean guessing at both.
 *
 * ## The escape hatch, and why it is honest
 *
 * A {@link CustomRenderPass} hands the pass the {@link Renderer} and gets out of
 * the way — that is the seam for anything the declarative shape cannot say (a
 * pass that renders one view per target, a backend-specific trick, a chain
 * whose shape is computed per frame). §70's full-screen effects deliberately do
 * *not* go through it: they are a declarative pass kind of their own
 * ({@link EffectRenderPass}, R-6), because a pass whose sampling is stated in a
 * field can be checked, and one hidden behind a closure cannot — `effect-pass.ts`
 * argues that where the type lives. The graph does **not** pretend to
 * understand a custom pass:
 * {@link RenderGraph.validate} reports every custom pass as an `"opaque"` issue,
 * so a graph that silently stopped being checkable says so out loud instead of
 * reporting a clean bill of health it did not earn.
 *
 * ## Nothing here changes what a frame draws
 *
 * The graph is a driver, not a backend. A pass produces exactly the GL a
 * hand-written `renderer.render` with the same four arguments produces, in the
 * same order, and an application that never constructs a `RenderGraph` never
 * loads this module (it is a separate file with no side effects, so it
 * tree-shakes out). `tests/integration/render-graph.test.ts` asserts the first
 * half against a recording GL context, call for call.
 *
 * ## Sampling is discovered, not declared
 *
 * {@link RenderGraph.validate} finds what a pass *actually samples* by building
 * the pass's render list and looking for {@link isRenderTargetTexture} textures
 * on the materials — the same marker the WebGL backend reads to decide between
 * "bind the framebuffer" and "upload these texels", so the check sees exactly
 * what the backend will. That is a scene traversal per pass, which is why it is
 * a method you call at setup rather than a tax `execute` pays every frame: a
 * material's `map` can be reassigned between any two frames, so a cached result
 * would be unsound and a per-frame result would double the traversal cost of
 * every pass in the graph. Two consequences worth stating:
 *
 * 1. an invisible or disabled node contributes no render item, so a mirror
 *    toggled off is not reported until it is toggled back on;
 * 2. `validate()` reasons about the **enabled** passes only, because a disabled
 *    pass writes nothing this frame — which is precisely why a consumer of its
 *    target is reported as sampling an `"unwritten"` surface.
