/**
 * `RenderTarget` (§61, §48, §63, §77) — an off-screen surface a frame can be
 * drawn into, and the texture that surface can then be sampled as.
 *
 * §61's renderer interface declares
 * `createRenderTarget(options: RenderTargetOptions): RenderTarget`, §48 gives a
 * viewport an optional `renderTarget`, and §63 makes transient targets the
 * currency the render graph trades in. None of that is expressible while the
 * type itself does not exist, which is what this module fixes: **the minimal
 * render-target tier** — a sized colour surface with an optional depth buffer,
 * a stable identity, a version, and explicit disposal (§83).
 *
 * ```ts
 * const target = new RenderTarget({ width: 512, height: 512 });
 *
 * // Draw the scene from the mirror camera into the target…
 * renderer.render(scene, [mirrorView], undefined, target);
 * // …and sample the result in the next pass.
 * mirrorMaterial.map = target.colorTexture;
 * renderer.render(scene, [mainView]);
 *
 * target.dispose(); // §83
 * ```
 *
 * ## A render target is a CPU-side descriptor; GPU residency is a backend cache
 *
 * This is the same decision `Texture` and `BufferGeometry` already made, taken
 * again for the same reasons and stated here because §61's literal text points
 * the other way (decision, R-4, 2026-08-07).
 *
 * §61 hands render targets out through the *renderer*. That shape means an
 * application cannot describe a target before it has a renderer, must build a
 * second one to render the same view with a second renderer, and must re-create
 * every one of them by hand after a §61 context loss. `@four/render`'s
 * `texture.ts` rejected exactly that trade for textures and left
 * `createTexture` deferred; the WebGL backend's `TextureCache` and
 * `GeometryCache` are the proof that the alternative works. So a
 * {@link RenderTarget} is a plain, backend-free description of *what surface is
 * wanted* — `id`, `version`, size, format — and the backend allocates the
 * framebuffer the first time it is asked to draw into it, keyed on `id` and
 * validated by `version`, exactly as it does for a geometry or a texture. A
 * context loss drops the cache; the next frame re-allocates; the application
 * holds the same `RenderTarget` object throughout and is told nothing, which is
 * what §61's "re-creates engine-owned GPU resources on restore" asks for.
 *
 * {@link RenderTargetOptions} is still declared with §61's name and shape, so
 * the packet that wants a renderer-owned factory can add
 * `createRenderTarget(options)` over this type without re-shaping anything.
 * The typed TODO in `renderer.ts` records it.
 *
 * ## Render-to-texture is the point (R-4 → R-5, R-6)
 *
 * {@link RenderTarget.colorTexture} satisfies `@four/materials`'
 * `MaterialTexture` — the *same* contract `@four/render`'s `Texture` satisfies
 * — so the result of an off-screen pass is assignable to `UnlitMaterial.map`,
 * `LitMaterial.map`, or `SpriteMaterial.texture` with no adapter and no new
 * material type. That single property is what unblocks §48's minimaps,
 * mirrors, portals and 3D-previews-in-2D-UI, §63's transient resources, and
 * §70's post-processing chain: every one of them is "draw into a target, then
 * sample it".
 *
 * A backend has to tell the two apart, because a render-target texture has no
 * CPU-side texels to upload — it *is* the framebuffer's colour attachment.
 * {@link isRenderTargetTexture} is that seam: a marker-property guard, the same
 * duck-typed contract pattern as `isParticleDrawable` and
 * `isDirectionalLightSource`, so no backend needs to name this class and
 * `@four/render` needs no backend type.
 *
 * ## Staged, with the dates (2026-08-07, R-4)
 *
 * Named here rather than sketched, because each one is public shape that a
 * backend, the §79 scene format, and §63's graph would all have to agree on:
 *
 * - **Stencil attachments** (§67) — the WebGL 2 backend requests its context
 *   without a stencil buffer (`stencil: false`), so a stencilled *target* would
 *   be the only stencilled surface in the engine. R-7 owns the whole of §67 and
 *   this option lands with it.
 * - **Multiple render targets** (§63, §70) — one colour attachment here. The
 *   shape it wants is `colorTextures: readonly RenderTargetTexture[]`, which is
 *   why the accessor is named `colorTexture` rather than `texture`.
 * - **Multisampled targets** (§62's capability list) — needs
 *   `renderbufferStorageMultisample` plus a resolve blit, and a capability
 *   query to know it is available at the requested sample count.
 * - **Floating-point and other formats** (§62 "floating-point targets", §60a) —
 *   {@link RenderTargetFormat} is deliberately a one-member union rather than a
 *   `string`, so `format: "rgba16f"` is a compile error today instead of a
 *   silent no-op. Widening the union is how the format tier arrives.
 * - ~~**Depth textures**~~ — **landed 2026-08-09 with §69's shadow maps
 *   (R-18)**: {@link RenderTargetOptions.depthTexture} swaps the depth
 *   renderbuffer for a `DEPTH_COMPONENT24` *texture*, which is what a shadow
 *   comparison samples. What is still staged is the *material* half — a depth
 *   attachment is not offered as a {@link RenderTargetTexture}, so it cannot
 *   yet be assigned to a `map` slot. That needs an attachment discriminant on
 *   the texture contract (a backend resolving one has to bind the depth
 *   attachment, not the colour one) and a sampler policy of its own: a depth
 *   texture is not filterable, so the `LINEAR` state every material texture
 *   gets would make it incomplete. Both arrive with the packet that wants a
 *   depth buffer on screen — a debug view, §70's depth-of-field.
 * - ~~**`readPixels`**~~ — **landed 2026-08-29** (§61, §92): `Rectangle2`
 *   arrived in `@four/math` (RFC 0005's recorded prerequisite) and
 *   `Renderer.readPixels?(target, region?)` left `renderer.ts`'s typed TODO
 *   for the interface itself; `read-pixels.ts` carries the shared §85 region
 *   check and the structural guard. The WebGPU and WebGL 2 backends both
 *   implement it.
