/**
 * Raster painting (§77a; RFC 0004, accepted 2026-08-21) — a surface an
 * application paints and the engine reads: {@link RasterSource} is the read
 * seam, {@link CanvasTexture} the `MaterialTexture` it produces.
 *
 * ## What this is, and what it deliberately is not
 *
 * §50–§52 specify a vector 2D stack whose content is *scene data*; this module
 * is the sanctioned exception to it, added by amendment rather than by
 * accident: a texture whose texels are produced by something other than the
 * engine — a minimap, a gauge face, procedural art, the §73 canvas view. The
 * engine's whole contribution is **a buffer, a version, a size rule, and a
 * place to put it**. It gains no `fillRect`, no path builder, no font
 * rasterizer, and no compositing model (§77a states this normatively): every
 * pixel is painted by the host or the application, and an engine-defined
 * drawing API is RFC 0004's rejected alternative C — §50–§52 and §58
 * re-invented in raster form.
 *
 * Nor is this §62's Canvas 2D *backend* (`render-canvas`, an unchanged
 * reserved stub). A backend draws the scene into a host canvas; this seam
 * reads arbitrary pixels out of one. The two share a host surface and nothing
 * else — RFC 0004 §2c is the table.
 *
 * ## The seam is structural and DOM-free
 *
 * In the discipline of `TextureSource`, `FetchLike`, `PointerSurface`, and
 * `SurfaceObserver`: the engine names a shape, the host supplies a value, and
 * the browser adapter is a few lines in the application. `@four/render`
 * compiles with no `lib.dom`, so a seam naming `HTMLCanvasElement` would not
 * even compile (RFC 0004, alternative F). The adapter the discipline promises:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const canvas = new OffscreenCanvas(256, 256);
 * const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d")!;
 *
 * const source: RasterSource = {
 *   width: 256,
 *   height: 256,
 *   origin: "top-left",                       // what every host 2D API produces
 *   paint: () => drawMinimap(ctx, world),
 *   readPixels: (out) => out.set(ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 256, 256).data),
 * };
 * const texture = new CanvasTexture(source);
 * material.map = texture;                     // it is a MaterialTexture
 *
 * // whenever the minimap should change:
 * texture.invalidate();
 * // once per frame, from render/real time — never from a fixed step (§33):
 * texture.update();                           // repaints and re-reads only if stale
 * ```
 *
 * {@link RasterSource.paint} takes **no parameter**, and that is the seam
 * holding: a callback taking an engine-defined context would make the engine
 * define a drawing API (alternative C), and one taking the host's context
 * would make the engine name a DOM type (alternative F). The source closes
 * over whatever it paints with; the hook exists only so the engine can order
 * the repaint against the read.
 *
 * ## Determinism (§33): painted pixels are display content, never simulation input
 *
 * Host-rendered raster output is not reproducible — font rasterization,
 * anti-aliasing, and GPU-backed `getImageData` all differ by platform and
 * driver — so §77a's rule is §40's display-only rule with one word changed:
 * **nothing inside §33's envelope may read painted pixels.** No value derived
 * from a {@link RasterSource} or a {@link CanvasTexture} may reach a fixed
 * step, a §33 checksum, a §34 snapshot, or a replay document; and
 * {@link RasterSource.paint} / {@link CanvasTexture.update} must never be
 * called from a fixed step (§9: they belong to render or real time — a repaint
 * driven from `fixedUpdate` couples an unreproducible cost to the §10
 * accumulator). `tests/integration/raster-display-only.test.ts` enforces the
 * import half mechanically, in the pattern §40's `units-display` test
 * established; what it cannot enforce — an application branching its own
 * fixed-step logic on `texture.data` — is documented there rather than implied
 * away. A `CanvasTexture` consequently has **no §79 representation**: A-16's
 * resources-are-keys rule leaves a painted surface, which has no key, with
 * nothing to write, so no scene document can carry unreproducible pixels.
 *
 * ## §96: finite limits, and no way in for untrusted content
 *
 * {@link CanvasTextureOptions.maximumBytes} defaults to **64 MiB** — A-23's
 * asset default, exactly a 4096 × 4096 RGBA8 surface, which is also the
 * `maxTextureSize` most WebGL 2 devices report — with
 * `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` as the explicit in-source opt-out, per A-23's "a
 * limit defaulting to `Infinity` is documentation, not a limit". A source an
 * application wrote with bad dimensions is a §85 programming error
 * (`RangeError`, matching `Texture`'s validation); a source whose dimensions
 * came from *decoded external content* would be refused with
 * `UNTRUSTED_INPUT_REJECTED` per A-23 — **no such source ships** (decode is
 * deferred with `ImageBitmap` sources, RFC 0004 §6), which is what keeps that
 * distinction honest rather than a stub that refuses nothing. And
 * {@link RasterSource.paint} is **application code the application imported**
 * — a function value, passed to a constructor. It is not loaded content, it is
 * not named by a scene document, and {@link CanvasTexture} accepts no URL and
 * no module specifier (RFC 0002's plugin rule, in a second place).
 *
 * ## Ownership and accounting (§83)
 *
 * The engine owns the buffer; the source owns the pixels. One `Uint8Array` of
 * `width * height * 4` bytes is allocated at construction and reused for the
 * texture's life — no per-frame allocation, and the §83 totals
 * (`textureMemoryBytes`, `liveTextureCount`, via `noteTexture`) have something
 * concrete to count, which is exactly what the application-side repaint recipe
 * this class replaces could not report (§84's `textureMemory` under-reported
 * by the most churn-heavy allocation an application makes).

 * material.map = texture;      // any MaterialTexture slot
 * texture.invalidate();        // the surface changed

 *
 * ## `update()` is called by the application, never by the engine
 *
 * Nothing polls, nothing subscribes, and no per-frame hook exists — the
 * "version, not events" stance `Texture` records, which also keeps this tier
 * off the render loop's critical path. The consequence is documented rather
 * than papered over (RFC 0004 Q6, adopted: no hook, no staleness warning): an
 * application that forgets `update()` after `invalidate()` sees a stale
 * texture and no diagnostic.
 *
 * ## The size is fixed for the texture's life
 *
 * {@link RasterSource.width}/{@link RasterSource.height} are re-validated on
 * every {@link CanvasTexture.update}; a source that changes size is refused
 * with `INVALID_APPLICATION_STATE` (§89) rather than silently reallocated.
 * Resizing means constructing a new `CanvasTexture` and disposing the old one.
 * This is deliberate and gated, not provisional: §77's change notification is
 * `R-30`'s unshipped half, R-29 recorded that a §55 sprite `frame` is
 * validated against its texture's size only at write time, and a version bump
 * tells a cache to re-read, not a dependent to re-validate — so in-place
 * resize is forbidden precisely so the stale-frame hazard cannot arise, and
 * lifting the restriction is explicitly gated on `R-30` (RFC 0004 Q5,
 * adopted).
