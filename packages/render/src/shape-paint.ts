/**
 * The §58 paint-object tier — validation and paint-to-graph lowering behind
 * `registerShapePaints()` (2026-08-29; R-16's recorded follow-up, unblocked
 * by RFC 0001).
 *
 * ## What this module is
 *
 * `shape.ts` owns what a paint *is* — the {@link Paint} union, the two-tier
 * rule on `Shape2DOptions.material`, and the registration slot — and this
 * module is what fills the slot: §85 validation for the three object paints,
 * and a **lowering** that turns a resolved fill/stroke pair into a §60
 * `NodeMaterial` whose graph evaluates the paints per fragment. The two live
 * in separate modules for the same reason `gl-node-program.ts` lives behind
 * `node-pipeline-registry.ts`: everything `Shape2D` reaches statically rides
 * in every bundle that draws a shape, so the tier's whole cost sits behind an
 * explicit call and a bundle that never authors a gradient carries none of it
 * (A-3's rule — the thing that needs the feature is a module, so a
 * lazily-filled module `let` works).
 *
 * ## Where it lives, and why (§3.1, §98)
 *
 * §98 files "paints" under `@four/materials`, but the paint *objects* belong
 * to §50's shape node — R-16's landed decision, restated by §50's own example
 * (`fill`/`stroke` are constructor options of the shape) — and `materials`
 * cannot see `ShapeFill` without inverting the frozen matrix (`render`
 * imports `materials`, never the reverse). So the lowering sits beside the
 * family that owns the paints, in `@four/render`, and consumes the §60
 * builder through the `render → materials` edge that has existed since
 * wave 3. No §3.1 edge moves.
 *
 * ## The lowering, exactly
 *
 * - A **solid** paint is a `vec4` constant (opacity folded into alpha).
 * - A **linear gradient** reads the shape's local `position.xy` — the space
 *   the paint's own `from`/`to` are authored in — and computes
 *   `t = p · k + k₀` (the axis normal equation, precomputed in f64), then the
 *   stop ramp below.
 * - A **radial gradient** computes `t = |p − center| / radius`, then the
 *   ramp.
 * - A **conic gradient** computes
 *   `t = fract((angle(p − center) − startAngle) / 2π)` — polar angle of the
 *   local offset, RFC 0001's `angle` operator — then the same ramp. Offset 0
 *   sits on the `startAngle` ray from +X; the parameter increases
 *   counter-clockwise and wraps.
 * - The **stop ramp** is the exact per-fragment form
 *   `c(t) = c₀ + Σᵢ (cᵢ − cᵢ₋₁) · saturate((t − pᵢ₋₁) / (pᵢ − pᵢ₋₁))`,
 *   with a zero-width segment (a hard edge) contributing through
 *   `step(pᵢ, t)` instead — every operator in §60's closed set, no facet
 *   anywhere, and padding before the first stop and past the last falls out
 *   of the `saturate`s with no case of its own.
 * - A **pattern** samples its texture at the shape's uv (the `[0, 1]²`
 *   bounding-box parameterization every shape geometry carries), through an
 *   optional `uv × repeat + offset` transform; tiling is the texture's own
 *   `wrap` mode's business (§77).
 * - When fill and stroke draw **different** paints, the graph blends the two
 *   evaluations with `mix(fill, stroke, color.x)` over the selector stream
 *   the geometry bakes (`0` fill, `1` stroke — exact at both ends), and
 *   {@link ShapePaintPlan.selector} tells the shape to bake it.
 *
 * A **conic** gradient is the same lowering as the others once §60 carries
 * `"angle"` (RFC 0001's one-row closed-union amendment). It stays behind
 * `registerShapePaints()`, so a bundle that never opts in still emits the
 * pictures it always did.
 *
 * ## Determinism (§33) and sharing
 *
 * The lowering is a pure function of the resolved paint **values**: node
 * creation order is source order, every derived constant is computed in
 * f64 from the authored numbers, and no collection enumeration order is
 * consulted — so the same pair lowers to the same node array and therefore
 * the same emitted GLSL/WGSL bytes, which is what makes N shapes naming one
 * paint share **one** compiled program through the backend's source-keyed
 * cache (RFC 0001 §2) with no cache of this module's own. Paint values are
 * baked as graph *constants* — the recorded trade: a paint is program
 * identity, so re-authoring one per frame compiles per distinct value
 * (documented on {@link Paint}); values-as-uniforms is the staged upgrade if
 * a consumer ever needs animated stops.
 *
 * ## §57 render state on the derived material
 *
 * The lowering sets `transparent` from the paint values — any folded alpha
 * below 1, or any pattern (a texture's alpha is data the lowering cannot
 * see) — so a translucent gradient blends without a knob the author has no
 * material to turn. Everything else stays at §57's defaults; an author who
 * needs more writes it onto `shape.material` post-construction, knowing a
 * later paint assignment re-derives it.
