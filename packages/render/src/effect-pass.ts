/**
 * §70's post-processing at the **full-screen effect tier** (R-6, 2026-08-07):
 * one render target's colour attachment drawn over another surface through a
 * fragment shader, described here with no backend types at all.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const sceneColor = new RenderTarget({ width: 512, height: 512 });
 *
 * const graph = new RenderGraph();
 * graph.addPass("world", { root: scene, views, target: sceneColor });
 * graph.addPass(
 *   "grade",
 *   {
 *     kind: "effect",
 *     source: sceneColor.colorTexture,
 *     effect: { kind: "grade", exposure: 1.2, saturation: 0.8 },
 *   },
 *   { inputs: ["world"] },
 * );
 *
 * graph.execute(renderer, { poseBuffer: poses, alpha: time.interpolationAlpha });
 * ```
 *
 * ## An effect is a graph pass, not a second orchestration mechanism
 *
 * This is the whole architectural point, and it is a recorded instruction
 * (R-5, 2026-08-07): §63 already owns "which pass runs when, writing what,
 * sampling what", so §70 gets a **third pass kind** rather than an `effects`
 * array on `Viewport`, a post-processing manager, or a chain object. An
 * {@link EffectRenderPass} is added, named, enabled, ordered, validated and
 * described by exactly the machinery `RenderGraph` already has, and — like a
 * {@link SceneRenderPass} — it becomes **one
 * renderer call**, which is what keeps R-5's "the graph is a driver, not a
 * backend" property true with two verbs instead of one.
 *
 * ### Why a first-class kind and not a `CustomRenderPass`
 *
 * `CustomRenderPass` is the escape hatch, and R-5 made it *report its own
 * opacity*: every custom pass emits an `"opaque"` issue because the graph
 * cannot see what it samples. An effect pass is the opposite case. Its sample
 * is not hidden inside a closure — it is the {@link EffectRenderPass.source}
 * field, right there in the descriptor — so the graph can check it **exactly**,
 * with no traversal at all, where a scene pass needs a whole render list built
 * to discover the same thing. Expressing §70 through the escape hatch would
 * have made every effect chain unvalidatable precisely where the two mistakes
 * it invites live: sampling the surface you are writing (`"feedback"`) and
 * consuming a target a later pass produces (`"order"`). A third member of a
 * union that was already discriminated (`kind`) costs one branch in `execute`,
 * one in `validate`, one in `describe`, and buys back the checking.
 *
 * ## What "the minimal tier" covers, effect by effect (§70)
 *
 * §70 lists ten effects and one composition rule. The ones that need nothing
 * but the source texel are shipped — the blit, the colour grade, and (since
 * R-15, 2026-08-08) the sRGB half of §60a's output transform; the rest each
 * need a *resource* this renderer does not have yet, and are named with the
 * packet that brings it rather than approximated.
 *
 * | §70 requirement                     | this tier                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
 * | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | tone mapping                        | **half shipped** (R-15, 2026-08-08) — §60a defines the output transform as tone mapping *followed by sRGB encoding*, and {@link OutputTransformEffect} ships the encoding half as §60a's final render-graph pass. The operator itself stays staged for the reason this row always gave: it compresses an HDR range onto 0…1, every surface here is `rgba8` (R-4's one-member `RenderTargetFormat`), and there is no range to compress. It lands as a *field on that effect* when float targets do. |
 * | color grading                       | **shipped** — {@link ColorGradeEffect}: exposure, contrast, saturation                                                                                                                                                                    |
 * | bloom                               | **staged** — a bright-pass plus a separable blur is three passes over half-resolution surfaces, i.e. §63's *transient target pool*, which R-5 staged for a stated reason (it needs a size/format key and a lifetime analysis)              |
 * | anti-aliasing                       | **staged** — FXAA/SMAA are neighbourhood filters and need the source's texel size and a luma pass; MSAA is a *target* capability (`renderbufferStorageMultisample` plus a resolve blit), staged on R-4                                     |
 * | depth of field                      | **staged** — needs samplable depth; a target's depth buffer here is a renderbuffer, and depth *textures* are staged with §69                                                                                                              |
 * | motion blur                         | **staged** — needs a velocity buffer, hence multiple render targets (staged on R-4) and previous-frame matrices                                                                                                                           |
 * | screen-space ambient occlusion      | **staged** — samplable depth *and* normals: MRT plus depth textures, both above                                                                                                                                                           |
 * | outlines and selection highlighting | **staged** — needs a §71 GPU identifier buffer, a depth/normal edge pass, or §67's stencil (R-7). Named in the gap analysis as R-6's most-wanted consumer, and honestly still blocked on one of those three                                |
 * | distortion                          | **staged** — a screen-space displacement samples a second input (a flow map or a normal buffer); a pass here carries exactly one {@link EffectRenderPass.source}                                                                           |
 * | custom full-screen passes           | **shipped** (RFC 0001, 2026-08-28) — {@link GraphEffect}: a §60 shader graph in the `"screen"` domain, as data. The union stays closed; it gained one member whose payload is itself a closed structure, so `{ kind: "bloom" }` is still a compile error. No user shader *source* exists at any tier — that is the RFC's decision, made binding by spec revision 1.11 |
 * | "composable per viewport"           | **partial** — composition is per *pass*: a chain of effect passes ping-ponging between two targets composes freely, and a per-viewport chain is expressible by giving each viewport its own target. A per-viewport *rectangle* inside one effect pass is not: an effect covers its whole destination surface (see {@link EffectRenderPass}) |
 *
 * ## The closed union is the point, not a placeholder
 *
 * {@link ScreenEffect} is a discriminated union of named effects rather than a
 * `string` or a shader source, for the reason `RenderTargetFormat` is a
 * one-member union: `{ kind: "bloom" }` has to be a **compile error** while
 * bloom is staged, not a value that reaches a backend which quietly copies
 * instead. Every entry in the table above that says *staged* is therefore
 * unwritable, and the day one ships it is the day the union grows a member.
 *
 * ## Where an effect is validated (§85)
 *
 * At **setup**, by {@link RenderGraph.addPass}, through
 * {@link validateEffectRenderPass} — the same stance R-5 took for the graph's
 * resource checks, and for the same reason: a backend may not throw from inside
 * a frame (§61), and an effect's parameters do not change between the frames
 * that would be worth re-checking. An application that hand-writes
 * `renderer.renderEffect(pass)` without a graph bypasses that check exactly as
 * a hand-written `renderer.render` bypasses {@link RenderGraph.validate}, and
 * may call {@link validateEffectRenderPass} itself.

 *
 * ## What the numbers mean, precisely
 *
 * The pipeline is linear-light on the GPU backends (§60a), and these operate on
 * the values as stored — there is no perceptual curve in this tier, because the
 * output transform that would supply one is staged (see the module header).
 * Stated as arithmetic, per colour channel, with `a` untouched throughout:
 *
 * 1. **exposure** — `rgb *= exposure`. A linear-light scale, so `2` is one stop
 *    brighter, not "twice as bright" perceptually.
 * 2. **contrast** — `rgb = (rgb - 0.5) * contrast + 0.5`. The pivot is `0.5`
 *    *linear*, which is not perceptual mid-grey; the pivot moves to mid-grey
 *    when §60a's transform lands, and that is a deliberate difference recorded
 *    here rather than a rounding of it.
 * 3. **saturation** — `rgb = mix(vec3(luma), rgb, saturation)`, with `luma` the
 *    Rec. 709 linear-light weighted sum (`0.2126 R + 0.7152 G + 0.0722 B`);
 *    `0` is greyscale, `1` is unchanged, above `1` oversaturates.
 *
 * Nothing is clamped by the effect: the destination surface's format does the
 * clamping it does (`rgba8` saturates), and a float target — when R-4's format
 * union widens — will not. Alpha is never touched, so an effect pass over a
 * target with a transparent background composites afterwards exactly as the
 * source would have.

 *   "present",
 *   { kind: "effect", source: sceneColor.colorTexture, effect: OUTPUT_TRANSFORM_EFFECT },
 *   { inputs: ["world"] },
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why this is a pass and not a step in every shader
 *
 * Because §60a says so, in one sentence: "the output transform — tone mapping
 * (§68) followed by sRGB encoding — **is the final render-graph pass** (§63)".
 * The alternative — an encode appended to the unlit, lit, standard, sprite and
 * particle fragment stages — would encode *five times* into one framebuffer,
 * make every blend between two draws happen in the wrong space, and multiply
 * the backend's shader variants by two. As a pass it runs exactly once, after
 * everything has been composited in linear light, which is the property that
 * makes the transform correct rather than merely present.
 *
 * ## Opt-in, and what that costs (the dated deviation)
 *
 * §60a describes the transform as *the* final pass, i.e. always present. Here
 * it is a pass an application **adds**, and a scene that does not add it renders
 * exactly the frame it rendered before this existed — byte-identical GL,
 * byte-identical pixels. That is deliberate (R-15, 2026-08-08): every scene,
 * example and pixel golden in this repository was authored against an untagged
 * pipeline whose *output* happened to be its working space, and an
 * on-by-default encode would relight all of them at once. Making it default is
 * an owner decision, and the honest sequence is: ship the transform, let a
 * scene opt in, move the goldens deliberately rather than as a side effect.
 *
 * ## Tone mapping is the half that is still staged
 *
 * §60a's transform is *tone mapping then encoding*, and this effect performs
 * the encoding only. The reason is unchanged from R-6 and is a resource, not a
 * preference: an operator compresses an HDR range onto 0…1, every surface in
 * this tier is `rgba8` (R-4's one-member {@link RenderTargetFormat}), and there
 * is no range to compress. When float targets land, tone mapping arrives as a
 * field on **this** effect — the two halves belong to one pass — rather than as
 * a sixth member of the union.
 *
 * ## What an `rgba8` intermediate costs, stated rather than hidden
 *
 * The source of this pass is a linear-light `rgba8` surface, so the frame is
 * quantized to 256 linear steps *before* it is encoded. sRGB spends more of its
 * code space on darks than linear does, so re-encoding an 8-bit linear buffer
 * can band in shadow gradients in a way a directly-encoded framebuffer would
 * not. The fix is a wider intermediate (`rgba16f`), which is the same staged
 * {@link RenderTargetFormat} widening tone mapping waits on — not a change to
 * this pass. Named here because it is the one visible difference between this
 * tier and a complete §60a pipeline.
 *
 * ## The arithmetic, exactly
 *
 * Per colour channel, `@four/math`'s `linearToSrgb`: the IEC 61966-2-1
 * piecewise curve, odd-extended below zero. **Alpha is not encoded** — it is a
 * coverage fraction, not a light quantity — which is the same rule
 * `srgbToLinearRGBA` follows on the way in. Nothing is clamped by the effect;
 * the `rgba8` destination saturates on write, as it does for a grade.

/**
 * Checks an {@link EffectRenderPass} against §85, throwing a `RangeError` on
 * the first violation and returning nothing when the pass is well formed.
 *
 * Called by {@link RenderGraph.addPass} for every effect pass, which is where
 * an application normally meets it; exported because an application that hand
 * -writes `renderer.renderEffect` has no graph to do it (module header).
 *
 * Four things are checked, and deliberately nothing else:
 *
 * 1. **`source` really is a render-target texture** — the marker guard, not the
 *    type, because a JavaScript caller can hand over anything and a backend
 *    that met a plain `Texture` here would silently draw a black screen;
 * 2. **`effect.kind` is a member of the closed union** — a value TypeScript
 *    would have rejected, arriving from JSON or from JavaScript;
 * 3. **each declared grading coefficient is finite and non-negative** — a
 *    `NaN` reaching a `uniform3fv` produces an entire black frame with no
 *    error anywhere, which is the failure this function exists to prevent;
 * 4. **an output-transform pass reads linear and writes sRGB** — §60a's
 *    colour-space metadata, checked where a double encode is still a wiring
 *    mistake rather than a washed-out frame.
 *
 * Not checked: whether the source is disposed, and whether it is the same
 * surface as `target`. Both are *frame*-time facts (a target may be disposed
 * long after the pass was added), both are already handled where they belong —
 * {@link RenderGraph.validate} reports the second statically as `"feedback"`
 * and every backend refuses both at draw time (§83, R-4).
