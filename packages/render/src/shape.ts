/**
 * §50's native 2D shape system — the node tier (R-23, 2026-08-09).
 *
 * §49 puts a `Shape2D` family under `Renderable`; §50 lists the fourteen shape
 * primitives that family has to express. This module is that family, built
 * entirely on the substrate the two preceding packets landed: §51's `Path`
 * (`R-24`) describes every shape, `Path.fillRings` sorts its subpaths into
 * filled regions and the holes cut out of them, and §52's `triangulatePolygon`
 * (`R-25`) turns each region into indices. Nothing here re-implements geometry:
 * a shape node is a set of validated parameters, a `toPath()` that spells them
 * as §51 commands, and a lazily rebuilt `BufferGeometry`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const ring = new Ring({
 *   innerRadius: 0.6,
 *   outerRadius: 1,
 *   material: new UnlitMaterial({ color: [0.27, 0.4, 1, 1] }),
 * });
 * scene.add(ring);
 * ring.innerRadius = 0.8;   // validated, and rebuilt on the next read
 * ```
 *
 * ## The tier this ships, and the tier it does not (2026-08-09, R-16)
 *
 * **Fill and stroke, both, in solid colours.** `R-23` shipped this family at
 * the fill-only tier and named §58 as the owner of everything it was missing;
 * `R-16` is that owner, and what it brought is:
 *
 * - {@link Paint} and {@link SolidPaint} — §58's paint model at its solid
 *   tier, as a **closed one-member union** so the six staged kinds are a
 *   compile error rather than a silently ignored object. See {@link Paint} for
 *   why per-vertex colour is exact for a solid and for nothing else §58 lists,
 *   and what the exact tier costs;
 * - {@link StrokeStyle} — §58's interface, over §52's `expandStroke`: width,
 *   `inside`/`center`/`outside` alignment, butt/round/square caps,
 *   miter/round/bevel joins with a miter limit that falls back to a bevel, and
 *   dashes with a phase offset. Every row of §50's "dashes and dash offset",
 *   "miter, bevel, and round joins" and "butt, square and round caps";
 * - {@link Shape2D.fill} and {@link Shape2D.stroke}, and the `fill:`/`stroke:`
 *   constructor options §50's own example writes;
 * - **{@link Line}, {@link Polyline} and {@link Arc}** — the three §50
 *   primitives that had no class at all, because they are only a stroke. With
 *   them the family covers **all fourteen** of §50's rows.
 *
 * The stroke's geometry is not here. §52 puts stroke expansion in
 * `@four/geometry`'s tessellation module by name, beside the fill
 * tessellator, and that is where it went (`expandStroke`); this module
 * decides what a stroke *is* and lets §52 decide where its triangles are.
 *
 * The §58 **paint-object tier** joined on 2026-08-29 (R-16's recorded
 * follow-up, unblocked by RFC 0001): {@link LinearGradientPaint},
 * {@link RadialGradientPaint}, {@link ConicGradientPaint} (unlocked once
 * §60's `angle` operator landed) and {@link PatternPaint} — the latter covering
 * §58's "image pattern" *and* "render-target texture" rows, because a
 * `RenderTarget.colorTexture` is a `MaterialTexture` — are accepted by
 * {@link ShapeFill} and {@link StrokeStyle} and lowered to a §60 `NodeMaterial`
 * the shape derives and owns as its material (see {@link Paint} for the
 * mechanism, and `shape-paint.ts` for the lowering). The tier is opt-in:
 * `registerShapePaints()` links the lowering, exactly as
 * `registerNodeMaterialPipeline()` links the emitter that draws it.
 *
 * What §58 still asks for and this does not answer, each with a named owner:
 * the "procedural shader" row as a paint *object* (a procedural paint **is** a
 * `NodeMaterial`, authored directly — see {@link Paint}), and §52's
 * anti-alias fringe, which needs a coverage attribute no §57 pipeline reads.
 *
 * The fourteen §50 rows and the classes that answer them:
 *
 * ```text
 * circle             Circle
 * ellipse            Ellipse
 * rectangle          Rectangle
 * rounded rectangle  Rectangle, with radius > 0   (§50's own example)
 * regular polygon    RegularPolygon
 * arbitrary polygon  Polygon
 * star               Star
 * line               Line
 * polyline           Polyline
 * arc                Arc
 * sector             Sector
 * ring               Ring
 * path               PathShape
 * Bézier path        PathShape, over a path carrying Bézier segments
 * ```
 *
 * Two of those mappings are decisions rather than transcriptions:
 *
 * - **§49's `RoundedRectangle` is `Rectangle` with a corner radius.** §49's
 *   tree names them as two classes; §50's *example* — the more specific
 *   normative statement, because it is the constructor call the spec itself
 *   writes — is `new Four.Rectangle({ width: 200, height: 100, radius: 12 })`.
 *   Two classes with one shape between them would mean two node types in §79
 *   and a document whose class depends on whether an author happened to type
 *   the rounded name.
 * - **§50's "path" and "Bézier path" are one class.** §51's `Path` already
 *   carries quadratic and cubic segments; a second node differing only in which
 *   command kinds its path happens to hold would be distinguishing data, not
 *   shape.
 *
 * `RegularPolygon`, `Star`, `Sector` and `Ring` have no row in §49's tree and
 * are required primitives in §50's list; they join the family because the
 * family is how this engine expresses a §50 primitive.
 *
 * ## Why these are `Renderable` subclasses and not one data-driven node
 *
 * §49 draws the alternative and rejects it: it puts eight *named classes* under
 * `Shape2D`, and §50 writes `new Four.Rectangle({ width, height })`. A single
 * `Shape2D` node carrying `{ kind: "rectangle", … }` would make that
 * constructor unwritable, would hand every shape every other shape's
 * parameters, and would move validation from a constructor signature into a
 * run-time switch. The shared behaviour that a data-driven design would buy —
 * flattening, tessellation, caching, dirtying, disposal — is in the abstract
 * base instead, which is where inheritance puts it.
 *
 * ## Material: `UnlitMaterial`, honestly, and **still no `ShapeMaterial`**
 *
 * §57's family lists `ShapeMaterial`, and `R-23` did not ship it because
 * without §58 it would be `UnlitMaterial` renamed. §58 has now landed and the
 * answer is **unchanged**, which is worth stating rather than leaving to
 * inference: at the solid-paint tier the paints are baked into the geometry's
 * per-vertex colours, so a `ShapeMaterial` would still carry nothing a
 * backend reads that `UnlitMaterial` does not. §58's fill and stroke live on
 * the **node**, where §50's own example puts them
 * (`new Four.Rectangle({ …, fill, stroke })` is a shape constructor, not a
 * material one), and a stroke's width and joins are geometry rather than
 * shading in any case.
 *
 * The pipeline that was to give the class content arrived — RFC 0001's §60
 * node pipeline, the `RenderItemKind` arm and compiled program R-16 priced as
 * the exact tier's cost — and the answer is **still** no `ShapeMaterial`,
 * re-decided a third time (2026-08-29, the paint-object tier): a
 * gradient-painted shape's material is a §60 `NodeMaterial` the shape derives
 * from its own paints (see {@link Paint}), so a class named `ShapeMaterial`
 * would either *be* `NodeMaterial` renamed or carry a `kind: "node"`
 * discriminant that lies about what it discriminates — R-16's argument, one
 * material family later. The paints stay on the **node**, where §50's own
 * example puts them, and the material is derived data.
 *
 * A shape that names no object paint carries a `SurfaceMaterial` and draws
 * through the existing flat-colour pipeline — with `vertexColors` doing the
 * work, which is a uniform switch the pipeline already has. The consequence
 * worth stating plainly, and true of the paint-object tier too: **this module
 * changes no backend, adds no render-item kind, and touches no frame path.**
 * A gradient-painted shape is an ordinary `"node"` item to `buildRenderList`,
 * and a scene that draws no shape issues exactly the GL calls it issued
 * before, by construction rather than by measurement.
 *
 * Like `Renderable`, every class here is generic in its material and defaults
 * to `SurfaceMaterial`, for that class's reason: the render list picks a
 * pipeline from the material's own `kind` (§57, §64), so a consumer's material
 * — and a §79 document naming one this build has never heard of — draws exactly
 * as authored instead of being refused by a whitelist.
 *
 * ## Geometry: owned, derived, and rebuilt lazily
 *
 * A shape **owns** its `BufferGeometry` (§83) the way §55's `Sprite` owns its
 * quad, and for the same reason: it is a function of the node's parameters, not
 * something handed in. Writing any parameter marks it stale; the rebuild
 * happens on the next read of {@link Shape2D.geometry}, so a burst of edits in
 * one frame costs one tessellation rather than one per edit, and a shape nobody
 * draws is never tessellated at all.
 *
 * The geometry **object** is created once and its buffers are replaced in
 * place, so its `id` is stable across rebuilds and a backend's `GeometryCache`
 * re-uploads the entry (an `id` hit with a stale `version`) instead of leaking
 * the old one behind a new id — the property `Sprite` documents and the reason
 * the class holds a private reference rather than reassigning the inherited
 * slot. Unlike a sprite's quad, a shape's vertex *count* changes with its
 * parameters, so the arrays are reallocated rather than rewritten; the
 * assignment order below (`indices` and `uvs` dropped first) is required by
 * §53's validate-against-current-attributes rule, exactly as
 * `applyDebugDrawStreams` documents.
 *
 * ## Validation: refuse, never clamp (§85)
 *
 * Every parameter is a validated accessor (the F14 policy): a non-finite
 * radius, a negative width, a corner radius that does not fit the rectangle, an
 * inner radius that is not inside its outer one, or a polygon of two points
 * throws a `RangeError` naming the class and the parameter. Nothing is clamped,
 * nothing is silently reinterpreted, and a refused write leaves the shape
 * exactly as it was.
 *
 * A shape whose parameters are legal but enclose no area — a sector of zero
 * sweep, a polygon whose points are collinear — is **not** an error: it
 * tessellates to nothing and draws nothing, which is `fillRings`' own answer
 * for a ring that bounds nothing, and is a state an author animating a
 * parameter through zero passes through legitimately.
 *
 * ## What §50 still asks for, named rather than sketched
 *
 * Clipping and masks: they need §57's `stencil`, which no backend reads.
 * Boolean geometry operations: §51's four booleans, staged by `R-24` for the
 * one planar-subdivision packet §52's self-intersection rule also waits on.
 * Local and world bounds: `geometry.computeBounds()` gives the local box today;
 * the world box is §87's traversal. Analytic hit testing: `A-11`, which names
 * this packet as its blocker and wants an RFC. SVG import/export: `R-26`, and
 * {@link Shape2D.toPath} is the seam it needs — every shape here answers with a
 * §51 path, so an exporter never learns what kind of shape it is holding.

 *
 * - **procedural shader** — *is not a paint object and does not need to be*:

 *   the shape's material. Wrapping a shader graph in a `Paint` would add a
 *   second spelling for the same object with §79 obligations §60 already
 *   declined (a material is a catalog reference, not a document).
 *
 * ## How each tier reaches the screen (R-16, extended 2026-08-29)
 *
 * A **solid** paint travels as §53 per-vertex colour through the material the
 * author supplied — R-16's tier, unchanged to the byte: no new item kind, no
 * pipeline, no frame-path edit, and per-vertex colour is *exact* for a flat
 * colour.
 *
 * An **object** paint cannot ride that path exactly (a radial gradient is not
 * affine; a pattern is a texture read), so it takes the pipeline RFC 0001
 * built: the shape **derives its own material** — a §60 `NodeMaterial` whose
 * graph evaluates the paint per fragment, exactly — and is an ordinary
 * `"node"` item to the render list. That is why an object-painted shape is
 * constructed *without* a `material` (§85 refuses the pair loudly): the paint
 * *is* the material, and R-16's two objections to a shape inventing one
 * dissolve at this tier — the derived material owns no GPU resource the
 * application must dispose, and §79 writes the paint itself, not a key.
 *
 * The tier is **opt-in**: call `registerShapePaints()` once (it installs the
 * paint-to-graph lowering, the same move as `registerNodeMaterialPipeline()`
 * and the §37/§62 registries), or authoring an object paint throws naming the
 * call. A bundle that never registers carries none of the lowering.
 *
 * N shapes naming the same paint values lower to the same graph bytes, so the
 * backend's source-keyed program cache compiles **one** program for all of
 * them (RFC 0001 §2; the lowering is a pure function, §33). The paint values
 * are baked into the graph as constants — re-authoring a paint every frame
 * therefore compiles per distinct value and is the wrong tool for animation;
 * animate the node, the material's §57 state, or a pattern's texture instead.

 * hole is its own region, which is exactly how the middle of a letter "e"
 * survives) — and then, after the last fill vertex, the whole stroke band.
 * `polygonGeometry2D` is the single-region form of this and is deliberately
 * not called: it builds a whole geometry per region, and a shape owns one.
 *
 * **The stroke's triangles come last, and that is load-bearing.** They occupy
 * the same plane as the fill, so what decides which one is visible where they
 * overlap is the depth comparison — and §61's backend contract fixes it at
 * `LEQUAL`, so equal depths let the *later* draw through. Index order inside
 * one geometry is draw order, so a stroke written after the fill paints over
 * it, which is the way round every 2D system draws them.
 *
 * Uv is the bounding box of everything emitted, normalized to `[0, 1]²`,
 * matching `polygonGeometry2D` and `extrudeGeometry`'s caps so a texture lines
 * up on a filled shape and on the front of its extrusion. With no stroke that
 * is exactly the box over the regions' outlines — holes are inside their
 * outline by construction — which is why adding the stroke's vertices to it
 * leaves an unstroked shape's uv stream byte for byte unchanged. Both spans
 * stay strictly positive whenever there is a vertex at all: `fillRings` drops
 * every ring enclosing zero area, and a stroke band is two-dimensional in both
 * axes for any polyline it does not drop.
 *
 * `colors` is emitted **only** when a §58 paint was authored, and then for
 * every vertex: the fill's half gets `fillColor`, the stroke's gets
 * `strokeColor`, and whichever half named no paint gets the identity
 * `(1, 1, 1, 1)` so the material's own colour reaches it unmultiplied. A shape
 * with no paint at all therefore carries no colour stream, and its geometry is
 * identical to the one `R-23` built before §58 existed.

   *   object paint is refused: the material would be silently ignored, which
   *   is "accepted and ignored" wearing a disguise.
   *
   * §50's example writes `fill: "#4466ff"` *instead of* a material, and at
   * the solid tier that stays unsupported for R-16's recorded reasons (an
   * invented material is an undisclosed §83 liability and §79 has no key for

/**
 * A 2D shape (§49, §50) — the abstract root of the shape family.
 *
 * A subclass supplies validated parameters and a {@link Shape2D.toPath}; this
 * class owns everything downstream of it: flattening, tessellation, stroke
 * expansion, the derived geometry, its dirtying, and its disposal. See the
 * module header for the tier this ships at and why there is still no
 * `ShapeMaterial`.
 *
 * Consumers can extend it: a class that answers `toPath()` with a §51 path is a
 * full member of the family, gets a rebuilt fill and stroke for free, and needs
 * nothing from this module that is not public.
 *
 * ## How a paint reaches the screen (decision, `R-16`, 2026-08-09)
 *
 * A fill and a stroke are two colours, and a node draws **one** geometry with
 * **one** material — §49's `material: Material[]` and the submesh ranges it
 * needs are `R-27`'s residue, not this packet's. So the two colours travel as
 * §53's **per-vertex colour stream**: the fill's triangles carry the fill
 * paint, the stroke's carry the stroke paint, and the §57 pipelines already
 * multiply `vertexColors` into the material's own colour
 * (`fragment = color × vColor`, `R-19`). One geometry, one draw, one material,
 * **no new render-item kind, no new backend pipeline, no frame-path edit** —
 * `R-23`'s property, kept.
 *
 * Two consequences an author has to know, both refused rather than surprising:
 *
 * - a material that does not multiply vertex colours cannot draw a paint, so
 *   authoring one on such a material throws (§85) naming `vertexColors: true`;
 * - the drawn colour is `material.color × paint`, so a material left at its
 *   `UnlitMaterial` default of white draws the paint exactly.
 *
 * ## …and how an *object* paint reaches it (the paint tier, 2026-08-29)
 *
 * A gradient or pattern is not a colour per vertex, so the per-vertex channel
 * carries something else: a shape constructed without a material (see
 * {@link Shape2DOptions.material}) derives a §60 `NodeMaterial` whose graph
 * evaluates its paints **per fragment**, and when fill and stroke draw
 * different paints the colour stream bakes the two-valued *selector* the
 * graph's `mix` reads — `0` on every fill vertex, `1` on every stroke vertex,
 * both exact. Still one geometry, one draw, one material; the item's kind is
 * `"node"`, so drawing it needs the backend's node pipeline registered
 * (`registerNodeMaterialPipeline()` on WebGL 2) and an unregistered frame
 * **skips** the shape with the pipeline's own one-time warning rather than
 * approximating it — a paint the author wrote is a specific picture (§60's
 * rule, which this tier inherits rather than re-decides).

/**
 * An open circular arc about the node origin (§50 "arc") — the curve, not the
 * region.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const gauge = new Arc({
 *   radius: 1,
 *   startAngle: Math.PI,
 *   endAngle: 2 * Math.PI,
 *   stroke: { width: 0.06, lineCap: "round" },
 *   material,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * §50 lists "arc", "sector" and "ring" as three primitives, and this is the
 * one of the three that is only a curve: {@link Sector} is the arc closed back
 * through the centre and {@link Ring} the arc's annulus, and both of those
 * ship a *region*. The parameters are {@link Sector}'s, deliberately — a
 * `Sector` and an `Arc` written with the same three numbers describe the same
 * curve, and the difference between them is exactly the two radii `Sector`
 * adds.
 *
 * The sweep follows §51's Canvas rule, counter-clockwise from `startAngle` and
 * wrapped into one turn, so `0 → 4π` and `0 → 2π` are both a whole circle. A
 * zero sweep draws nothing, which is where a dial animating from empty starts.
