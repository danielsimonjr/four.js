/**
 * The §62 backend registry — how a name becomes a renderer without this
 * package, or the `four` umbrella, ever importing a backend (R-2, A-8).
 *
 * §45 spells the application's renderer option
 * `"auto" | "webgpu" | "webgl2" | "canvas2d" | "svg"`, and §62 says what
 * `"auto"` means: *"Automatic selection should prefer WebGPU, then WebGL 2,
 * then an appropriate 2D backend. If WebGPU initialization fails at runtime
 * under `"auto"`, selection falls back to WebGL 2 and emits a diagnostics
 * event; an explicit `renderer: "webgpu"` fails fast with
 * `RENDERER_INITIALIZATION_FAILED` (§89) rather than silently downgrading."*
 *
 * The obvious implementation — a `switch` over the string that constructs the
 * matching class — is the one this repository may not have. It would make the
 * module holding the switch import **every** backend package, so every program
 * that ever named `Application` would carry a WebGL renderer, a WebGPU
 * renderer, a Canvas renderer and an SVG renderer whether or not it drew a
 * single pixel; §91's tree-shaking requirement and the 14.88 kB example that
 * WP-3.6 measured are both spent in one line. That is the whole reason
 * `ApplicationOptions.renderer` has been an *instance* since Phase 3 (MEMORY,
 * 2026-08-01).
 *
 * So the dependency is inverted: **backends register themselves into this
 * neutral host**, and the name is resolved against whatever the application
 * actually imported.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { registerWebglRenderer } from "@four/render-webgl";
 *
 * registerWebglRenderer();                      // the app names its backends
 * const app = new Application({ renderer: "auto", canvas });
 * await app.initialize();                       // resolves against the registry
 * ```
 *
 * The §3.1 matrix is unchanged and no edge is added: `render-webgl` already
 * depends on `render`, and `four` already depends on `render`. Nothing here
 * imports a backend, at type level or at runtime.
 *
 * ## Explicit registration, never a side-effect import (decision, 2026-08-07)
 *
 * Registration is a **function the application calls**, not something an
 * `import "@four/render-webgl/register"` performs on evaluation. Every package
 * in this workspace declares `"sideEffects": false`, which is precisely the
 * promise that importing a module and using nothing from it may be deleted —
 * a side-effect registration module would be *correctly* dropped by any
 * bundler that believes the manifest, and would then fail at runtime with
 * "nothing is registered". The two ways out are both worse than an explicit
 * call: carving an exception into every backend's `sideEffects` field defeats
 * the field's purpose, and dropping the field entirely un-shakes the whole
 * package. An explicit `registerWebglRenderer()` is a value the bundler can
 * see being used, so it survives for exactly the programs that want it and
 * disappears from the ones that do not.
 *
 * ## What an application that never selects by name pays: nothing
 *
 * {@link resolveRenderer} deliberately does **not** mention
 * {@link RendererRegistry}. It reads a module-level slot that only
 * {@link registerRenderer} ever writes, so a bundle whose application hands
 * `Application` a concrete instance retains the eight-line resolver and its
 * error text, and drops the registry class, the `Map`, the §62 preference
 * order, and every backend along with them. Measured on the four size-limited
 * examples: unchanged to the byte after minification except for that resolver
 * (see the packet's size proof).
 *
 * ## The diagnostics event of §62, and why it is a callback
 *
 * §62 asks for "a diagnostics event" when `"auto"` falls back. The frozen §3.1
 * matrix gives `@four/render` no `@four/diagnostics` edge — `render` is wave 3
 * beside `diagnostics`, not above it — and this packet may not add one. The
 * report is therefore delivered through
 * {@link RendererResolveOptions.onFallback}, a callback the caller supplies;
 * an application that wants it on a diagnostics channel forwards it in one
 * line, which is the same shape `PointerInput` uses to stay DOM-free. The
 * information §62 asks to be reported — which backend was skipped and why — is
 * carried in full by {@link RendererFallbackReport}.
