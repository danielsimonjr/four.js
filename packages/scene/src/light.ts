/**
 * Lights (§68) — the multi-light tier: directional, point, and spot nodes.
 *
 * §68's initial light set is ambient, hemisphere, directional, point, spot,
 * and rectangular area. The §120 MVP shipped the two cheapest members
 * (2026-08-04); **R-17 adds the two positional ones on 2026-08-09** and leaves
 * the remaining two staged. What is here, and what is not:
 *
 * - **directional** — {@link DirectionalLight}, this module. Exactly one
 *   illuminates a frame: it is the sun, it has dedicated shader uniforms, and
 *   further directional lights are still ignored (deterministically —
 *   scene-graph order decides which one wins, §33). Widening *that* one means
 *   retiring the dedicated uniforms in favour of a third entry kind in the
 *   light set, which is the clustered/forward-plus path's job (§68) and not
 *   this tier's;
 * - **point** — {@link PointLight}, new. A position, an inverse-square falloff,
 *   and an optional range window;
 * - **spot** — {@link SpotLight}, new. A point light with a cone: an axis (the
 *   node's −Z, as a directional light's) and two half-angles;
 * - **ambient** — still a *scene-wide constant term* on `Scene.ambientLight`
 *   rather than a node: with exactly one value per scene there is nothing
 *   positional about it, and a node would only add a traversal to find it;
 * - **hemisphere** and **rectangular area** — staged (2026-08-09). Neither is a
 *   punctual light: a hemisphere light is a two-colour directional *ambient*
 *   term (sky above, ground below) that belongs beside `Scene.ambientLight`
 *   rather than in the punctual set, and a rectangular area light needs the
 *   linearly-transformed-cosine machinery §68's "where supported" already
 *   hedges on. Both are absent rather than accepted-and-ignored;
 * - **shadows** (`castShadow` in §68's own example) ship for the *directional*
 *   light only, at §69's directional-shadow-map tier (R-18, 2026-08-09):
 *   {@link DirectionalLight.castShadow} and {@link DirectionalLightShadow}.
 *   A {@link PointLight} and a {@link SpotLight} carry no `castShadow` at all
 *   — absent rather than accepted-and-ignored — because §69's answer for them
 *   is a cube map and a per-light shadow index that the single-map tier has
 *   nowhere to put. See {@link DirectionalLightShadow} for the whole staged
 *   list (cascades, point and spot shadows, atlas, contact shadows);
 * - §68's **CSS color strings** denote sRGB values (§60a). A light option
 *   now accepts either a linear {@link ColorRGB} tuple or a CSS string
 *   (`#rgb`/`#rrggbb`, `rgb()`/`rgba()`); a string is parsed and decoded to
 *   linear-light before it is stored, so the uploaded uniforms stay the
 *   same numbers they have always been;
 * - physically coherent units, light layers, environment/image-based
 *   lighting, tone mapping, and exposure (§68's requirements list) are all
 *   staged with their owning designs.
 *
 * A light is a {@link Node} — the placement decision cameras made (§47,
 * spec rev 1.3 put cameras in `@four/scene`): it sits in the scene graph,
 * is parented, animated, and driven like anything else, and a light on a
 * turntable is a light added under the turntable's node.
 *
 * ## Direction
 *
 * A directional light shines along its node's **−Z axis in world space** —
 * the direction a camera looks (§7a, plan D8), so the same rig conventions
 * aim both. An unrotated light therefore shines toward −Z; a sun overhead is
 * the node rotated −π/2 about X (shining −Y, §7a's "down"). The node's world
 * *position* is irrelevant, as §68's directional model requires. A
 * {@link SpotLight} aims its cone along the same axis, so one rig points
 * either kind; a {@link PointLight} has no axis at all and reads only its
 * node's world *position*.
 *
 * ## Intensity, and what a light's numbers mean
 *
 * `color × intensity` is an **irradiance already divided by π** — the
 * radiometric convention R-13 wrote down on 2026-08-08 and the reason neither
 * the Lambert lobe nor the GGX one carries a `1/π`. For a directional light
 * that product *is* the irradiance on a surface facing it. For a point or spot
 * light it is the irradiance at **unit distance** (one metre, §40), which the
 * inverse-square falloff then scales — so a `PointLight` and a
 * `DirectionalLight` of equal `intensity` agree exactly on a surface one metre
 * away and facing both. That is the whole content of the choice: it makes the
 * two kinds comparable without introducing a candela/lumen conversion §68's
 * "physically coherent units *where practical*" does not yet pay for.
 *
 * ## The renderer contract
 *
 * `@four/render` discovers lights **structurally** (its `lights.ts` declares
 * the `DirectionalLightSource` and `PunctualLightSource` shapes) — the same
 * duck-typed pattern as its `ParticleDrawable`, though for the opposite
 * reason: the dependency edge render → scene exists, but the *WebGL backend's*
 * unit tests build scenes from typed doubles and an `instanceof` check would
 * be unfakeable there. `@four/render`'s own tests pin these classes against
 * the contracts, so drift is caught at type level where the particle contract
 * can only catch it by test.

/**
 * How a {@link DirectionalLight} casts (§69) — the shadow-map resolution, the
 * two bias controls, and the orthographic volume the map covers.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const sun = new DirectionalLight({ intensity: 3, castShadow: true });
 * sun.shadow.mapSize = 2048;
 * sun.shadow.extent = 12;      // a 24 m × 24 m box about the light's position
 * sun.shadow.bias = 0.002;
 * ```
 *
 * Every property is a **validated accessor** (the F14 policy, 2026-08-07): the
 * constructor's §85 check runs again on every write, so a `NaN` map size is a
 * `RangeError` at the assignment that caused it rather than a black frame three
 * systems later. Nothing here is clamped or reordered — WP-3.3's
 * no-silent-rewrites rule — so an unusable value is *refused*, never quietly
 * repaired.
 *
 * ## The volume, and why it is authored rather than fitted
 *
 * A directional light has no position as far as *lighting* is concerned (§68 —
 * see {@link Node.getWorldDirection}), but a shadow map is a
 * rendering of a bounded volume and something has to bound it. This tier takes
 * the volume from the light's own node: the map is rendered from the light's
 * **world position**, looking along its **−Z axis**, through an orthographic
 * box `2 × extent` wide and tall with the near and far planes below. Moving or
 * aiming the light node therefore moves the shadow volume, which is the one
 * control an author already has in their hands.
 *
 * The alternative — fitting the box to the scene's bounds every frame — is
 * *not* this tier's, and deliberately: it needs a world-space bounds pass this
 * engine does not yet run (§87's culling packet owns it), and a volume that
 * silently resizes makes shadow texel density frame-dependent, which is the
 * shimmer §33's determinism language exists to keep out of a recorded run.
 *
 * ## Staged, with the date (2026-08-09, R-18)
 *
 * §69 lists ten features; this settings object is sized for the one tier that
 * ships. Named here rather than sketched, because each is public shape:
 *
 * - **cascaded shadow maps** — one map, one volume. Cascades need a split
 *   scheme, a map per split, and a per-fragment cascade selection, and they
 *   are what make a *large* outdoor volume workable; `extent` is the honest
 *   single-cascade knob until then.
 * - **point-light cubemap shadows** and **spot-light shadows** — neither
 *   {@link PointLight} nor {@link SpotLight} carries `castShadow` at all (see
 *   the module header). A cube map needs six passes and a `samplerCube`; a
 *   spot needs a perspective shadow matrix and a *second* map slot, which is
 *   the shadow-atlas item below.
 * - **shadow atlas management** — one map, one caster light. An atlas is what
 *   turns "a per-light shadow index" into something a bounded uniform set can
 *   address.
 * - **transparent shadow masks** — the depth-only pass writes geometry, not
 *   alpha, so a sprite or a cut-out texture casts nothing here (§55 quads are
 *   skipped by the caster pass entirely rather than casting a hard rectangle).
 * - **contact shadows** — a screen-space effect, and so §70's business rather
 *   than this record's.

/**
 * The shared half of §68's two *positional* light types — a light that has a
 * place in the world and fades with distance from it (R-17, 2026-08-09).
 *
 * Abstract because §68 has no "punctual light" of its own: the class exists so
 * that {@link PointLight} and {@link SpotLight} cannot disagree about what
 * `color × intensity` means, how `range` windows the falloff, or where the
 * light *is*. Concrete subclasses add only what distinguishes them, which for
 * a spot light is exactly a cone.
 *
 * ## Falloff (§68, "physically coherent units where practical")
 *
 * Irradiance at distance `d` is `color × intensity / d²` — the inverse-square
 * law, unmodified, because a point emitter genuinely obeys it and any
 * "smoother" curve would be an art direction rather than a light. The one
 * departure is {@link PunctualLight.range}, glTF's `KHR_lights_punctual`
 * window:
 *
 * ```text
 * attenuation = clamp(1 − (d / range)⁴, 0, 1) / d²          range > 0
 * attenuation = 1 / d²                                       range = 0
 * ```
 *
 * The window is a **culling aid, not physics**: it drives the contribution
 * smoothly to exactly zero at `d = range` so a renderer may one day skip the
 * light beyond it without a visible seam. `range = 0` — the default — declares
 * that no such cut-off exists, which is why the default is the honest one.
 *
 * The `1/d²` term is evaluated in the shader with `d²` floored at a tiny
 * epsilon, so a surface *at* the light's exact position renders very bright
 * rather than `NaN`; the floor lives where the division does, the placement
 * rule R-13 fixed for `roughness`.

 *
 * Nothing here clamps or reorders the two angles (WP-3.3's no-silent-rewrites

 * cone: `@four/render` divides by `max(cos inner − cos outer, 1e-6)`, which
 * turns the ramp into a step rather than into a division by zero. An angle
 * past `π/2` is likewise expressible and lights a hemisphere or more — a
