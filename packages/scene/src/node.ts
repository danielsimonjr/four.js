/**
 * The unified node model (§6), its component delegation (§6a), and its event
 * surface (§6b).
 *
 * `Node` is the one base class of the scene graph: 2D shapes, 3D meshes, text,
 * UI, rigid-body hosts, and particle emitters are all nodes, and everything a
 * node *does* beyond hierarchy and transform arrives either as a subclass or —
 * preferably — as a component (§6a). The base class therefore stays
 * lightweight: hierarchy, transform, identity, visibility, tags, metadata,
 * components, events.
 *
 * ## Inheritance (plan D1)
 *
 * `abstract class Node extends EventEmitter<NodeEventMap>` — single
 * inheritance, no mixins. Components are **composed**, not inherited: every
 * node owns a private `ComponentRegistry` (`@four/core`) and delegates
 * `addComponent` / `getComponent` / `removeComponent` to it, passing *itself*
 * as the registry's host. `@four/core` cannot name `Node` (the dependency runs
 * the other way, plan §3.1), so it describes the host structurally as
 * `ComponentHost`; `Node` implements that interface, which is what makes
 * `component.host` the owning node at runtime. §6a's `Component.node` is that
 * same reference under core's package-neutral name.
 *
 * ## Events (§6b)
 *
 * Nodes emit through the shared `EventEmitter`, so all four §6b rules
 * (unsubscriber return, registration-order dispatch, mutation-takes-effect-next
 * -dispatch, no self re-entrancy) hold here without restatement. This packet
 * defines only the two structural events, `added` and `removed`; see
 * {@link NodeEventMap} for how later packets widen the map.

   * to `node.rotation.setFromAxisAngle(...)`, and like every direct write it
   * neither checks nor warns about {@link Node.transformAuthority} (decision,
   * R-36). §42's enforcement is deliberately *writer-side* — a system tests
   * ownership once per node per step, immediately before it would write (see
   * `warnAuthorityConflict`) — and `Node.lookAt` is not a system: it is the
   * application, i.e. the `"manual"` authority itself. Warning here would make
   * this the only transform write in the engine that self-polices, and it would
   * fire on the most ordinary setup there is — aiming a `"physics"`-owned body
   * or a `"kinematic"`-driven turret at its starting pose before the owning
   * system has stepped. A rig that wants to aim a node *every frame* under a
   * non-manual authority has the same obligation as any other writer: claim the
   * authority, or let the owner do the writing.
   *
   * ## Degenerate aims are refused (§85)
   *
   * `FourError("INVALID_SCENE_GRAPH")` is thrown, and nothing is written, when
   *
   * - `target` coincides with this node's world position (or either is
   *   non-finite): there is no direction to face; and
   * - `up` is zero, parallel to the aim, or non-finite: the aim leaves the roll
   *   about it completely undetermined — the top-down `lookAt` from directly
   *   above with the default +Y `up` is exactly this case, and wants an
   *   explicit `up` such as world −Z.
   *
   * Refusing rather than substituting is §85's "detect singular transforms"
   * applied at the point of authoring, reported under the same code
   * {@link Node.add} uses for §85's scene-graph rule so one `catch` covers both.
   * Silently picking a fallback `up` — the usual engine behaviour — would
   * rewrite the orientation the caller asked for and hide the mistake behind a
   * plausible-looking roll; leaving the node unturned would be indistinguishable
   * from a frozen rig. A rig that can reach a degenerate configuration (an orbit
   * at zero radius, a follow target that catches its camera) must guard the
   * call, exactly as it must guard a division by its own radius.
   *
   * Allocates nothing: the aim, the world rotation, and the parent's rotation
   * live in module scratch.

   * `node.transformAuthority = "physics"` — and that is exactly what it is:
   * read it, write it, one value at a time. **Every** value of
   * {@link TransformAuthority} assigns, `"blended"` included: it was guarded
   * by a `FourError("NOT_IMPLEMENTED")` between WP-2.3 and WP-7.3, because
   * nothing implemented §19's physics-animation pipeline and a node claiming
   * it would have been owned by a system that did not exist. `PhysicsWorld`
   * now runs that pipeline (`@four/physics`, plan P7-4), so the guard is gone
   * and the value means what §42 says it means.
   *
   * A `"blended"` node is driven by §19's pipeline, which needs two more things
   * this field cannot check for — a `RigidBody` registered with a
   * `PhysicsWorld` and a `PoseTarget` on the node. The first step that
   * tries to blend a node with no target throws `FourError` naming it; see
   * `PhysicsWorld.step`. Assigning the authority is never itself an error,
   * exactly as `"kinematic"` on a node no controller drives is not.
   *
   * Enforcement lives in the writing systems (see `warnAuthorityConflict`), not
   * here: `Node` records ownership, systems honour it.
