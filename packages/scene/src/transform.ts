/**
 * Local/world transform of a scene node (§7).
 *
 * The transform is authored as translation, rotation, scale, and pivot and is
 * composed into {@link Transform.localMatrix} as the §7 product
 * `T · Tp · R · S · Tp⁻¹` — translation, then rotation and scale **about the
 * pivot**. The pivot therefore affects rotation and scale but never
 * {@link Transform.position}: a node sits at `position` whatever its pivot is,
 * and the pivot only decides which point of the node stays fixed while it turns
 * or grows. See `Matrix4.compose`, which evaluates that product directly.
 *
 * ## The dirty channel (plan D3)
 *
 * Dependent systems cache against {@link Transform.version}, so every local
 * mutation has to be visible. There are exactly two ways to mutate a transform,
 * and both keep `version` correct:
 *
 * 1. **Method-based mutation** — the normal path. The constructor installs an
 *    `onChanged` hook on this transform's own `position`, `rotation`, `scale`,
 *    and `pivot`, so any math *method* call on them bumps `version` once:
 *
 *    ```ts
 *    transform.position.set(1, 2, 3); // version += 1
 *    transform.scale.scale(2);        // version += 1
 *    ```
 *
 *    One method call is one bump, including methods that write several
 *    components; `Vector3.copy` and `Quaternion.copy` deliberately do not copy
 *    the source's hook, so copying another vector in keeps this channel intact.
 *
 * 2. **Direct field writes** — legal, but they bypass the hook by design (the
 *    same rule the math types state for `v.x = 1`), so the caller must announce
 *    them:
 *
 *    ```ts
 *    transform.position.x = 5;
 *    transform.markDirty(); // version += 1
 *    ```
 *
 * The four math members are `readonly` for this reason: replacing one wholesale
 * (`transform.position = someVector`) would silently drop the hook and leave
 * `version` frozen while the transform kept moving. Write *into* them instead.
 *
 * {@link Transform.localMatrix} deliberately carries **no** hook — it is the
 * output of composition, and a hook there would mark the transform dirty every
 * time it was recomposed.
 *
 * ## Local matrix
 *
 * With `matrixAutoUpdate = true` (the default) the local matrix is owned by the
 * engine and {@link Transform.updateLocalMatrix} recomposes it from
 * position/rotation/scale/pivot — lazily: it recomposes only when `version` has
 * advanced since the last composition, so calling it repeatedly in a frame costs
 * one comparison.
 *
 * With `matrixAutoUpdate = false` the **user** owns the local matrix (§7):
 * `updateLocalMatrix()` becomes a no-op and position/rotation/scale are *not*
 * back-derived from the matrix — they simply go stale and stop describing the
 * node. Write the matrix through {@link Transform.setLocalMatrix} so `version`
 * still advances; writing `localMatrix.elements` directly needs a following
 * {@link Transform.markDirty} exactly like a direct field write.
 *
 * ## World matrix
 *
 * {@link Transform.worldMatrix} and {@link Transform.worldVersion} are storage
 * for the world-transform resolver, which walks the hierarchy and is the single
 * writer of both (§7: world matrices resolve lazily, once per fixed step before
 * physics synchronization, before render-item generation, and on demand for
 * queries). This class never touches them: a lone `Transform` has no parent and
 * so cannot know its own world matrix. Reading `worldMatrix` without having
 * resolved it yields whatever the last resolution left there.
