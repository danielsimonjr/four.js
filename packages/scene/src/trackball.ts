/**
 * §44/§47's **trackball** rig (R-37, 2026-08-21) — the last of the seven camera
 * rigs that had a design reason to be somewhere other than `@four/motion`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const trackball = new TrackballRig({ width: 960, height: 540, distance: 6 });
 * // …from wherever your pointer events live, in viewport pixels:
 * trackball.drag(previous.x, previous.y, current.x, current.y);
 * trackball.applyTo(camera);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why it lives here and not with the other rigs
 *
 * `camera-rigs.ts` staged it with a one-line reason: "defined in **screen
 * space**, and `@four/motion` may not import `render` or `input` (§3.1); it
 * belongs with the §47 `ScreenCamera` packet." That is exactly right, and this
 * is that packet. A trackball is not parameterised by angles the way an orbit
 * rig is — its whole definition is *a mapping from two points on a viewport to
 * a rotation* — so the package that owns §48's `Viewport` and §47's
 * {@link ScreenCamera} is the one that can state it. `@four/scene` is also the
 * lowest package that can: it needs a rectangle and a quaternion, nothing else.
 *
 * ## It is a rig, not a component (decision, R-37)
 *
 * `OrbitRig` and `FollowRig` are components that `ConstraintSystem` calls once
 * per fixed step, under §42's `"constraint"` authority. A trackball is not that
 * shape, for two independent reasons:
 *
 * - **It is event-driven, not per-step.** Its state advances when a drag
 *   arrives and at no other time; a per-step `apply` would spend every fixed
 *   step re-writing a transform that had not changed. `OrbitRig` accumulates
 *   angles and *is* re-evaluated per step because its target may move; a
 *   trackball's pivot is a point the caller owns.
 * - **`ConstraintSystem` is in `@four/motion` and names its three component
 *   classes literally.** A component here could not be driven by it without
 *   `motion` importing `scene`'s rig — which the staging note exists to
 *   prevent. Inventing a second constraint system to drive one rig would be
 *   worse than admitting the shape is different.
 *
 * So {@link TrackballRig.applyTo} is called by the application, from the same
 * place the pointer event was handled, and the node it writes is under §42's
 * default `"manual"` authority — the application *is* the writer. A node owned
 * by another system is refused through `warnAuthorityConflict`, once, exactly
 * as a system's own write would be: §42 does not exempt application code.
 *
 * ## The mapping (the classic virtual sphere)
 *
 * A screen point becomes a point on a unit sphere centred on the viewport, and
 * the rotation of a drag is the rotation that takes the first sphere point to
 * the second. Inside the sphere's silhouette the height is
 * `sqrt(1 - d²)` out to its 45° parallel; beyond that the sphere is continued by
 * the hyperbolic sheet `1 / (2d)`, and the result is normalized. The two meet
 * tangentially at `d = 1/√2` — same height, same slope — which is what stops
 * the rotation from dying at the rim and lets a drag past the edge keep
 * spinning (Shoemake's arcball with Bell's sheet: the mapping every trackball
 * in the wild uses, because the naive "clamp to the rim" version has a
 * discontinuous derivative exactly where users drag fastest).
 *
 * The composition is `rotation = delta · rotation`: the drag's rotation is
 * applied in **world** space, on the outside, so a second drag turns the object
 * about screen axes rather than about the axes the first drag left behind. That
 * is the property that distinguishes a trackball from an orbit rig, and it is
 * why a trackball can reach orientations an azimuth/elevation pair cannot (it
 * has no pole and no up vector).
 *
 * ## Parameter-driven, like every other rig (R-36)
 *
 * {@link TrackballRig.drag} takes four numbers in viewport pixels. There is no
 * `@four/input` import — `@four/scene` may not have one under the frozen §3.1
 * matrix — and, as R-36 recorded for the other rigs, that constraint is the
 * right design anyway: a rig whose only inputs are numbers is replayable (§34),
 * testable without a device, and leaves sensitivity, inversion and acceleration
 * where they belong, in the application.
 *
 * ## Refusals (§85) and determinism (§33)
 *
 * A non-finite coordinate, size, radius or distance is refused with
 * `RangeError` rather than clamped — the other rigs' rule, and the reason is
 * theirs: `NaN` is not a value at the end of a range, and a rig that swallowed
 * one would place its camera at `NaN` on some later frame instead of at the
 * mistake. A drag between two points that map to the *same* sphere point is not
 * an error: it is a drag of zero rotation, and it returns `false` after bumping
 * {@link TrackballRig.degenerateDrags} rather than writing an undefined axis.
 *
 * `sqrt`, `acos` and `sin`/`cos` are on the path, so this is §33's
 * **same-runtime** tier — the same statement every floating-point feature in
 * the engine carries. No clock, no RNG, no iteration order, and no allocation
 * after construction: the three scratch vectors and the delta quaternion are
 * per-instance.
