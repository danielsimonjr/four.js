/**
 * Previous/current pose storage and render interpolation (§43).
 *
 * Physics and every other fixed-step system advance the world at a fixed rate;
 * rendering happens at whatever rate the display runs at, usually somewhere
 * between two simulation steps. §43 states the fix:
 *
 * ```ts
 * renderPosition = lerp(
 *   previousPhysicsPosition,
 *   currentPhysicsPosition,
 *   interpolationAlpha
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * with "rotations should use quaternion spherical interpolation". That needs
 * somewhere to keep the *previous* pose, which is what {@link PoseBuffer} is.
 *
 * ## One store, one owner (§37)
 *
 * §37 says the previous pose used for render interpolation is "the solver's
 * pre-step body state, retained by the physics package". This buffer is that
 * retention, hoisted to the scene so that everything which moves a node —
 * `MotionSystem`, the kinematic controller, an animation track, and from Phase
 * 5 the physics adapter — is interpolated by one mechanism instead of one per
 * subsystem. There is exactly **one** previous/current store in the engine and
 * it lives here; the physics package will write into this same store rather
 * than starting a second one.
 *
 * Physics needs no extra API to do that: by the §39 order the solver publishes
 * solved transforms at step 6 (`PRIORITY_PHYSICS_SOLVE`) and the snapshot slot
 * runs at step 10 (`PRIORITY_SNAPSHOT`), so the capture below already sees the
 * post-solve pose of every body it tracks. See {@link createSnapshotSystem}.
 *
 * ## Local pose, not world pose (decision, WP-2.6)
 *
 * The buffer stores each node's **local** `transform.position` and
 * `transform.rotation`. Two reasons:
 *
 * 1. It is what the simulation systems actually write. `MotionSystem`, the
 *    kinematic controller, and the physics sync all author the local transform
 *    (a body's world pose is written into the local transform of a root-level
 *    node, or converted on the way in), so the local pose is the quantity that
 *    genuinely differs between two fixed steps.
 * 2. It is what §43's formula interpolates: position and rotation as a
 *    lerp/slerp pair. A world *matrix* cannot be interpolated that way at all
 *    without being decomposed first, and a decomposition per node per frame is
 *    exactly the cost this design avoids.
 *
 * A world render pose therefore derives the same way an ordinary world matrix
 * does — by composition through the hierarchy (`world-transforms.ts`) — with
 * interpolated local poses at each level. The consequence to know: if an
 * ancestor is tracked but a descendant is not, the descendant follows the
 * ancestor's interpolated motion (correct) but contributes its own un-lagged
 * local pose (also correct — it did not move). Only a node whose local pose
 * changes per step needs tracking.
 *
 * ## Render poses are presentation-only
 *
 * §43: "the render transform should not feed back into the physics state", and
 * §42 makes the same point from the authority side — interpolation is not a
 * transform writer and never becomes the owner of a node. So:
 *
 * > **A render pose must never be written back into `node.transform`.**
 *
 * {@link PoseBuffer.computeRenderPose} therefore writes into caller-owned `out`
 * objects and this module deliberately offers **no** API that assigns a render
 * pose to a transform. Writing one back would poison the next capture (the
 * interpolated pose would become the next "current" pose, and the simulation
 * would visibly lag and drift), and under §42 it would be a second writer of a
 * transform some other system owns. Renderers consume the `out` values
 * directly when they build their draw data; nothing else needs them.
 *
 * ## Allocation
 *
 * Steady state allocates nothing (§7b, plan D7): the per-node poses are
 * allocated once by {@link PoseBuffer.track} and copied into forever after, and
 * both capture and interpolation take their destinations as parameters. The
 * tracked set is iterated as an array, in insertion order (ground rule 5).
