/**
 * `layoutText` (§56 MVP tier) — a string plus a {@link GlyphAtlas} becomes a
 * list of textured quads in world units.
 *
 * This is pure arithmetic: no allocation of engine objects, no scene graph, no
 * renderer, no DOM, no measurement callback. Give it a string and it returns
 * where each glyph's rectangle goes and which part of the atlas it samples. A
 * caller turns those into geometry (`@four/geometry`), a sprite batch
 * (`@four/render`), or SVG rects — the layout never learns which.
 *
 * ## Coordinates (§7a)
 *
 * **Origin is the first line's baseline at its left edge**, and **+Y is up**, in
 * 2D exactly as in 3D. So `y0 < y1` in every quad, ascenders have positive `y`,
 * descenders negative, and the second line's baseline is at `y = -size`.
 *
 * Baseline-relative rather than top-left-relative because the baseline is the
 * line that text actually sits on: mixing two fonts, or two sizes, or an icon
 * with a label, aligns on baselines and on nothing else. A caller who wants
 * top-left origin subtracts `ascent`, which is on the atlas; a caller who wants
 * the text centred uses the returned `width`/`height`.
 *
 * ```text
 *            ┌───────┬───────┬───────┐   y1 = +ascent · scale
 *            │  ###  │  #    │       │
 *            │ #   # │  #    │  ###  │
 *   baseline ├───────┼───────┼───────┤   y = 0  ← the origin's row
 *            │       │       │    #  │
 *            └───────┴───────┴───────┘   y0 = −descent · scale
 *            x=0     ↑ advance · scale
 * ```
 *
 * ## `size` is world units per **line**, not per em
 *
 * `scale = size / atlas.lineHeight`, so `size` is the baseline-to-baseline
 * distance of single-spaced lines and the height of one glyph cell. Two
 * consequences, both intended: a block of `n` lines is exactly `n · size` tall,
 * and `size` means the same thing whatever a font's internal pixel grid is — a
 * 6 × 12 face and a 16 × 32 face at `size: 0.5` produce text of the same
 * physical height. Quoting a font size in em would make the same number mean
 * different heights per face, which is precisely the CSS behaviour that forces
 * everyone to measure.
 *
 * ## Horizontal alignment (R-28, 2026-08-13)
 *
 * {@link TextLayoutOptions.align} shifts each line within the widest line's
 * extent: `"left"` (the default) leaves the pen where it was, `"center"` and
 * `"right"` translate a line by `(width − lineWidth) · f` with `f = 0.5` and
 * `f = 1`. It is applied *after* the pen walk, because a line's own width is not
 * known until the line ends — which is also why the previous note here said an
 * alignment is "computed from this function's output". That note was right about
 * the arithmetic and wrong about the home: doing it outside would require the
 * caller to re-derive per-line widths that this function has already discarded,
 * so every caller would rebuild the same table. The output *shape* is unchanged,
 * exactly as predicted.
 *
 * `"left"` is not merely the default, it is a distinct code path: the shift loop
 * does not run at all, so a layout that does not ask for alignment produces the
 * numbers it produced before this option existed, bit for bit.
 *
 * ## What this tier does not do (§56, staged)
 *
 * Line **breaking** and wrapping (only an explicit `\n` breaks a line here),
 * **vertical** alignment, word spacing, rich-text spans, text on
 * paths, bidirectional reordering, shaping, ligatures, and kerning. §56 stages
 * shaping/bidi/ligatures behind a shaping-engine decision recorded by amendment;
 * wrapping is not blocked by that, it is simply the next packet — and it is a
 * *different* kind of change from alignment, because a wrap decides where lines
 * end (a word-breaking rule, i.e. UAX #14 and a language) rather than where a
 * finished line sits. Vertical alignment is a one-line offset the caller
 * already has the numbers for ({@link TextLayout.height}), and putting it here
 * would be inventing an origin convention that §56 does not state.

 *
 * ## Character handling
 *
 * - Iteration is by **code point** (`for…of`), so an astral character is one
 *   character and not two lone surrogates.
 * - `\n` ends the line: the pen returns to `x = 0` and the baseline drops by
 *   `size` (leading is exactly one line — see {@link TextLayoutOptions.size}).
 * - `\r` is **skipped entirely**, drawing nothing and advancing nothing, so
 *   CRLF-terminated text lays out identically to LF-terminated text (decision,
 *   WP-3a.4). A lone `\r` as a line terminator — Mac OS 9 and earlier — is not
 *   honoured as a break.
 * - Every other character absent from the atlas, control characters and tabs
 *   included, draws the fallback box and advances one cell. Nothing is silently
 *   dropped: an unrepresentable character is visible, which is what makes a
 *   missing script or a stray control byte diagnosable (§56's "font fallback"
 *   at this tier).
 *
 * ## Determinism (§33) — **cross-platform tier** (stated 2026-08-13, R-28)
 *
 * Pure: same string, same atlas, same options → identical numbers, always. No
 * clock, no randomness, no measurement of the environment.
 *
 * The claim is stronger than "same runtime", and mechanically so: every
 * arithmetic operation here is one of IEEE-754's **exactly rounded** ones —
 * `+`, `−`, `×`, `÷` and `Math.max` — over doubles, with no `sqrt`, no
 * transcendental, no `Math.fround`, and no iteration over a hash order (the
 * atlas is consulted with `Map.get`, never walked). Two conforming engines
 * therefore produce bit-identical quads, which is the tier `@four/geometry`'s
 * `triangulatePolygon` reached and `Path`'s arcs deliberately did not. An edit
 * that introduces a transcendental — a rotation, an italic shear, a
 * `Math.round` to whole texels — breaks this *stated tier*, not merely a number.
