/**
 * `UIWidget` (§73–§75) — the retained-mode UI layer's base class: a scene node
 * with a box model, an interaction state machine driven by §72 pointer events,
 * and a hit area the §71 picker can test.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const panel = new Panel({ layout: { type: "flex", direction: "column", gap: 12, padding: 20 } });
 * const start = new Button({ width: 160, height: 40, accessibility: { role: "button", label: "Start" } });
 * panel.add(start);
 * panel.layout();                                   // one explicit pass
 * start.on("uiactivate", () => simulation.start()); // §72 click → activation
 * ```
 *
 * ## The visuals contract — the decision this package is built around
 *
 * §73 says "UI objects are scene nodes and therefore share animation, input,
 * clipping, serialization, and diagnostics", and that is exactly what a widget
 * is here: a {@link Node}. What a widget is **not** is a thing that draws
 * itself, and that is not a stylistic choice — the frozen dependency matrix
 * (plan §3.1) gives `@four/ui` exactly `core`, `math`, `scene`, `input`, and
 * `text`. `Renderable`, `Sprite`, `Texture`, every material, and every geometry
 * live in packages this one may not import, and the plan's ground rule 9 is
 * "never add or reverse an edge". A widget therefore **cannot** own a quad, a
 * texture, or a material, and pretending otherwise would mean either an illegal
 * import or a fake.
 *
 * So the layer splits along the line the matrix draws:
 *
 * | this package owns                             | the application owns          |
 * | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
 * | hierarchy, box model, layout (§74 subset)      | backgrounds, borders, glyph quads |
 * | hit areas (§71 candidates)                     | textures, materials, batching |
 * | hover / press / focus state machines (§72)     | what those states *look* like |
 * | text **measurement** (`@four/text`, a real dep) | text **rendering**            |
 *
 * The seam is {@link WidgetSkin}: an application-supplied object with five
 * optional hooks that the widget calls when something visible about it changed.
 * The app's skin holds the imports `@four/ui` may not have, reads
 * {@link UIWidget.measuredWidth}, {@link UIWidget.measuredHeight},
 * {@link UIWidget.hovered} and friends, and builds or updates its own nodes —
 * typically as children of the widget, so the whole thing still moves as one
 * subtree. Nothing in this package ever learns what a skin drew.
 *
 * This mirrors the precedents already in the tree rather than inventing a
 * mechanism: `@four/text` "produces data, never nodes" for the same matrix
 * reason, `@four/particles`' `ParticleRenderable` implements a structural
 * contract it cannot import, and `@four/input` describes its surface
 * (`PointerSurface`) by what it touches instead of naming a DOM type. The
 * difference here is the direction of the call — a skin is supplied *to* the
 * widget rather than implemented *by* it — because the visuals are the
 * application's, not the engine's, until a package that may import `render`
 * ships a default skin.
 *
 * The rejected alternative was a `WidgetVisualFactory` returning opaque handles
 * the widget would then position. It buys nothing: positioning happens on the
 * widget's own transform, so the handle would only ever be passed straight back
 * to the code that made it, and every skin would have to invent a handle type.
 *
 * ## Coordinates (§7a, §74)
 *
 * The world is Y-up in 2D exactly as in 3D, and this layer does not bend that.
 * Everything in the box model is instead a **length or a fraction** — widths,
 * heights, paddings, margins, gaps, and normalized anchors — measured in a
 * top-left-origin, x-right, y-**down** frame, because that is the frame every
 * layout rule in §74 is stated in and reading order runs top to bottom. The
 * sign convention appears exactly once, where layout writes a transform:
 *
 * ```text
 * transform.position = (left, −top, z)      ← the only negation in the package
 * ```
 *
 * A widget's box in its own local space therefore spans `x ∈ [0, width]` and
 * `y ∈ [−height, 0]`: its origin is its **top-left corner**, and "down" is −Y.
 * A column stack advances in −Y; the hit area is `(0, −height, 0) …
 * (width, 0, 0)`.
 *
 * Layout units are just units. Point an orthographic camera at a
 * pixel-dimensioned frustum and one unit is one logical pixel (§74); scale the
 * UI root and the same tree lays out in world units over a 3D scene. §74's
 * device-pixel scaling belongs to the renderer's `resolution` (§47) and is not
 * modelled here.
 *
 * ## Transform authority (§42)
 *
 * A laid-out widget's position is owned by its parent's layout, and §42 requires
 * exactly one owner. Layout writes as `"constraint"` — §42's "a constraint/IK
 * solve owns the final pose", which is what a layout pass is, and the same
 * vocabulary §74 uses for its constraint layout mode. Widgets therefore declare
 * {@link UI_LAYOUT_AUTHORITY} at construction, and a widget whose authority is
 * something else (an `"animation"` tween sliding a panel in) has its position
 * write **refused with a warning**, exactly as `warnAuthorityConflict`
 * prescribes — its size, its hit area, and its children are still resolved,
 * since none of those is the transform. A root widget is written by nobody, so
 * its declared authority is inert; set it to `"manual"` if the application
 * places it, and nothing will ever warn.
 *
 * The write preserves `z`: layout owns the plane, the application owns depth.
 * That is what separates coplanar widgets for the picker (see
 * {@link collectPickables}).
 *
 * ## Layout is explicit
 *
 * `root.layout()` runs one measure pass and one arrange pass over the subtree.
 * There is no invalidation graph and no automatic pass: a retained-mode MVP that
 * silently re-laid-out on every field write would need change tracking on every
 * number in the box model, and the honest version of that is a later packet.
 * Call `layout()` after mutating the tree — typically once per frame at most.
 *
 * ## Allocation (§7b, plan D7)
 *
 * The layout passes allocate **nothing**: sizes live in fields, the intrinsic
 * measurement goes into a per-widget scratch `Vector2`, the hit area's two
 * vectors are written in place, and children are walked by index.
 * {@link collectPickables} fills a caller-supplied array. Interaction is
 * different by nature — a state change allocates its event and its two snapshots
 * — and that is deliberate: pointer transitions happen at human rates, an event
 * outlives its dispatch whenever a listener stores one, and `@four/input` makes
 * the same trade for the same reason.

 * const input = new PointerInput(canvas, {
 *   camera,
 *   pickables: () => collectPickables(uiRoot, candidates),

 *
 * A subtree is **pruned** at any node that is `visible = false` or
 * `enabled = false` — a hidden panel's buttons are not clickable, and pruning
 * at the node rather than filtering per widget means a plain `Group` hides its
 * UI descendants too. A widget that survives the walk is a candidate unless it
 * is {@link UIWidget.interactive} `= false`, which drops that widget alone and
 * keeps its children.
 *
 * The order matters: `pick` sorts hits by distance with a **stable** sort, and
 * coplanar widgets are all at the same distance, so a tie resolves to whichever
 * came first here — the ancestor. A child that must win over its parent needs a
 * real depth difference, which is why layout never writes `z`: set
 * `child.transform.position.z` (a few thousandths toward the camera is enough)
 * and the picker orders them properly.
 *
 * Zero-alloc when `out` is supplied: it is overwritten and truncated.
