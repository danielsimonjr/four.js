/**
 * `Slider` (§73) — a value dragged along a track (§72) or stepped with the
 * arrow keys (§75), 2026-08-07, A-12.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const gravity = new Slider({
 *   width: 200,
 *   height: 24,
 *   min: -20,
 *   max: 0,
 *   step: 0.5,
 *   value: -9.81,
 *   accessibility: { role: "slider", label: "Gravity" },
 * });
 * gravity.on("uivaluechange", (event) => world.gravity.y = event.current);
 * gravity.skin = trackSkin;              // reads `slider.fraction` to place the handle
 * ```
 *
 * ## What the widget owns, and what it hands the skin
 *
 * The range (`min`, `max`, `step`), the current {@link Slider.value}, and
 * {@link Slider.fraction} — the position in `[0, 1]` a skin draws a fill and a
 * handle from. The track, the handle, the tick marks, and the hit slop around a
 * thin track are the skin's, like every other visual in this package.
 *
 * ## Pointer interaction, and its one honest limit (§72)
 *
 * A press anywhere on the slider jumps the value to the pressed point (the
 * DOM's behaviour, and the one that makes a slider usable at all with a
 * touchscreen), and a move while pressed drags it. The position is read from
 * {@link ScenePointerEvent.worldPoint} — the §71 hit point — and transformed
 * into the slider's own local frame by the inverse of its world matrix, so a
 * slider works rotated, scaled, parented to a moving rig, or laid over a 3D
 * scene, with no assumption that the UI is screen-aligned.
 *
 * **The limit:** a drag that leaves the slider's box stops tracking, because
 * events stop arriving at it. The DOM keeps tracking through pointer capture,
 * and `PointerInput.setPointerCapture` exists — but a captured pointer
 * deliberately reports **no** `worldPoint` (there is no hit to report: the
 * target is the capturing node whatever the ray touches), so capturing would
 * turn a drag into a stream of positionless moves. Closing that needs a drag
 * plane — the ray/plane intersection `DragManager` documents as §71's analytic
 * tier — and is staged rather than faked (2026-08-07, A-12). Until then a
 * pointer drag is bounded by the widget, a keyboard drag is not, and
 * {@link Slider.setValueFromLocalPoint} is public so an application that has
 * its own drag plane can drive the same path this module drives.
 *
 * `DragManager` is not used here for the same reason: it converts screen motion
 * into a **world delta** for a node whose transform the callback writes, and a
 * slider's transform is owned by layout (§42) — what moves is a number, not the
 * widget. Its own documentation is explicit that what a drag *means* is the
 * application's decision; for this control the meaning is "set the value", and
 * that is this class's business.
 *
 * ## Keyboard (§75)
 *
 * Arrow keys step: Right and Up increase, Left and Down decrease — both
 * orientations, which is the DOM's convention and the one muscle memory has.
 * Home and End jump to the bounds. Auto-repeat is honoured, so a held arrow
 * sweeps the range. Everything else, including PageUp/PageDown, is left to
 * propagate: a large-step key is a fourth binding with no §75 mandate, and a
 * slider that swallowed the page keys would break scrolling in a host document
 * for nothing.
 *
 * The step a key takes is {@link Slider.step} when there is one, and **1% of
 * the range** for a continuous slider — a continuous control still has to move
 * by *something* per keystroke, and a percent of the range is the only choice
 * that is right at every scale.
 *
 * ## Orientation
 *
 * A vertical slider increases **upward**: `fraction` is `1` at the top of the
 * box and `0` at the bottom. That is a sign flip against the layer's
 * top-left-origin, y-down box model (see `widget.ts`), and it is deliberate —
 * a volume slider whose maximum is at the bottom would be wrong in every UI
 * ever shipped. The flip lives in one expression, in
 * {@link Slider.setValueFromLocalPoint}.
