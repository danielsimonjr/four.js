/**
 * `Text` (§49, §56) — a string, a font atlas and a material become **one** draw
 * call of positioned glyph quads (R-28, 2026-08-13).
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { buildGlyphAtlas } from "@four/text";
 * import { Texture } from "@four/render";
 * import { UnlitMaterial } from "@four/materials";
 * import { Text } from "four";
 *
 * const atlas = buildGlyphAtlas();
 * const font = new Texture({ ...atlas, filter: "nearest" });     // §77, R-30
 * const ink = new UnlitMaterial({ map: font, transparent: true });
 *
 * const label = new Text(atlas, ink, { text: "Motor 42 °C", size: 0.25 });
 * scene.add(label);
 * ```
 *
 * `@four/text` has produced glyph data since WP-3a.4 and no node consumed it, so
 * "text" was a quad calculator and every application assembled the label by
 * hand — one `Texture`, one `SpriteMaterial` and one draw *per glyph cell* in
 * the examples that tried. This class is the missing consumer.
 *
 * ## Why it lives in the umbrella and not in `@four/render` (decision, R-28)
 *
 * §49 puts `Text` in the `Renderable` family, and `Renderable` lives in
 * `@four/render`. The frozen §3.1 dependency matrix gives `render` the deps
 * `core, math, scene, geometry, materials` — **not `text`** — and gives `text`
 * the deps `core, math, geometry`, so neither package may import the other. The
 * matrix is frozen (plan §3.1: "never add or reverse an edge"), and the edge
 * that would be needed here is a *renderer depending on a font package*, which
 * is the wrong direction for the rest of the project's life.
 *
 * So the class goes to the one package that already sees both, which is this
 * one — the same argument `scene-serializers.ts` makes for itself ("the §3.1
 * matrix lets `@four/serialization` see `core`/`math`/`scene` only, and the
 * umbrella is the one place that may see `ui`, `render`, and `motion` too") and
 * the same shape §49's family already has: `ParticleSystem` (§36) is a §49
 * family member living in `@four/particles`, recognised by the render list
 * *structurally* because it may not even extend `Renderable`. `Text` does
 * better than that — being above `render` rather than beside it, it really is a
 * `Renderable`, so §49's hierarchy holds by inheritance and the render list, the
 * sort, the culler, §65 batching and §79 all take it with no special case.
 *
 * ## Why one geometry and the unlit pipeline (decision, R-28)
 *
 * A label could be N `Sprite` children over one atlas material — R-9's §65
 * batching would merge them into one draw, which is what the gap document
 * predicted. This class does not do that, and the reason is that it can do
 * better for less:
 *
 * - **One geometry per label is one draw call unconditionally**, where N sprites
 *   is one draw call *only when the application opted into batching*
 *   (`createGlBatching`) and N draw calls otherwise.
 * - **The uv are per vertex, which the sprite pipeline cannot express.** §55's
 *   quad derives uv affinely from position (`uv = (p.xy − quad.xy) / quad.zw`),
 *   which is exact for one rectangle sampling one sub-rectangle and cannot map
 *   twelve glyphs onto twelve different atlas cells in one buffer. §53's `uvs`
 *   attribute (R-19) and §57's `UnlitMaterial.map` can, and both already ship.
 * - **It costs the frame path nothing.** No `RenderItemKind` arm, no eighth
 *   pipeline, no shader edit, and `@four/render-webgl` is not opened by this
 *   packet at all: a `Text` is an unlit, textured, transparent draw, which is
 *   the pipeline `R-19` compiled and `R-16`'s shapes already use. Third
 *   application of R-23's "a packet can close a gap by adding nothing to the
 *   frame path".
 *
 * The consequence worth stating plainly: **many labels sharing one material
 * still batch.** Consecutive `Text` nodes over the same `UnlitMaterial` are a
 * run of same-material unlit items, which is exactly what `RenderBatcher`
 * merges, so a screenful of labels is one draw call under `createGlBatching`
 * and one draw *per label* without it. §65's "glyph batching" is therefore
 * closed at the label level here, and what remains of it is grouping labels that
 * do **not** share a material, which is atlas grouping (`R-9`'s own residue).
 *
 * ## The material, and the one check this class makes
 *
 * `Text` takes the material rather than building one, for the batching reason
 * above and for §83's: a texture and a material are shared, and a class that
 * minted its own would give every label a private atlas upload. The price is
 * that two things must agree — the {@link GlyphAtlas} the layout is computed
 * against and the texture the material samples — so the constructor and
 * {@link Text.atlas} **refuse** a material whose `map` is absent or is not the
 * atlas's size (§85). That is not a proof of identity, and it is the check that
 * catches the mistake anyone actually makes (an atlas rebuilt with different
 * padding, a material pointing at last week's sheet).
 *
 * It shares one hole with §55's `frame`, and for the identical reason: assigning
 * a different `material`, or a different `map` to the material, afterwards is
 * not re-checked, because neither setter is this class's. The label then samples
 * the wrong sheet. Re-validating on read would put a throw on the render path,
 * which §61 forbids.
 *
 * ## Ownership (§83)
 *
 * The **geometry is owned** — it is derived from the text, the size and the
 * atlas, so it belongs to the node and {@link Text.dispose} disposes it. The
 * atlas, the texture and the material are **shared and not disposed**, exactly
 * as `Sprite` treats its material.
 *
 * ## What of §56 ships here
 *
 * Bitmap text, basic Latin layout, explicit `\n` line breaks, baseline metrics
 * ({@link Text.layout}), letter spacing, and horizontal alignment. §56's MVP
 * clause allows precisely this ("initial releases may ship bitmap/SDF text with
 * basic Latin-script layout only"). Deferred with their reasons, none of them
 * silently: SDF/MSDF fields (an atlas producer, `glyph-atlas.ts`), wrapping (a
 * word-breaking rule, i.e. UAX #14 and a language), vertical alignment and rich
 * spans, text on paths (§51's arc-length parametrization), `space:
 * "billboard" | "screen"` (§55's `billboardMode`, which needs the camera inside
 * the model transform), selection and carets (§73's text input), and the
 * accessible semantic mirror (§75's DOM tier). Shaping, bidi and ligatures are
 * staged by §56 itself behind a shaping-engine amendment.
 *
 * §56's own example writes `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight` and `color`.
 * None of them is here, and that is the "absent beats accepted-and-ignored"
 * rule: this tier has one face, its size is world units per line rather than an
 * em size (see `text-layout.ts` for why that distinction is deliberate), there
 * is no weight axis to select, and the colour of the glyphs is the *material's*
 * `color` — which is where it has to be, because that is what a batch shares
 * and what §57 says a colour is.

 * The node's origin is the **first line's baseline at its left edge**, +Y up —

 * who wants the block centred on the node subtracts `layout.width / 2` and

 *
 * ## Rebuild cost
 *
 * The layout and the quad buffers are rebuilt **lazily, on the next read of
 * {@link Text.geometry}**, so a burst of edits in one frame costs one rebuild
 * rather than one per edit — `Sprite`'s contract, and `Shape2D`'s. The
 * geometry's `id` is stable across rebuilds, which is what makes a text change
 * cost one re-upload in the backend's `GeometryCache` instead of leaking the old
 * entry behind a new id.
 *
 * A rebuild that changes the glyph count changes the vertex count, and §53
 * validates every buffer against the ones already on the geometry — so the swap
 * passes through an **empty index buffer**, the one configuration legal at every
 * vertex count (R-23's pivot, recorded in `@four/render`'s `shape.ts`).
