/**
 * §79 node types and component serializers for the classes the engine itself
 * ships (A-14, PH-17 — 2026-08-06).
 *
 * §73 promises that "UI objects are scene nodes and therefore share animation,
 * input, clipping, serialization, and diagnostics", and §6a promises that
 * components "serialize under registered type names (§79)". Neither held.
 * `@four/serialization` may depend on `core`, `math`, and `scene` only (plan
 * §3.1), so its registry ships one component serializer (`PoseTarget`) and its
 * instantiator knows two node classes (`Scene`, `Group`) — every widget tree
 * round-tripped as bare `Node` state, and every `MotionComponent` was dropped
 * from the document with nobody able to notice.
 *
 * This module is where that is fixed, because **the umbrella package is the one
 * place allowed to see everything**. It adds no dependency edge anywhere: it
 * imports `@four/ui` and `@four/motion` the way an application would, and hands
 * `@four/serialization` the two things its documented seams ask for — a
 * `nodeTypeOf` / `nodeFactory` pair and a populated component registry.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { registerSceneNodeTypes } from "four";
 *
 * const io = registerSceneNodeTypes({ atlas });
 * const text = serialization.encodeSceneDocument(
 *   serialization.serializeScene(app.scene, io.components, io.write),
 * );
 * // … later
 * const scene = serialization.instantiateScene(
 *   serialization.decodeSceneDocument(text),
 *   io.components,
 *   io.read,
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * ## What is covered, and what is deliberately not
 *
 * Covered: the ten §73 widgets — `Panel`, `Label`, `Button`; since
 * 2026-08-07 (A-12), `Toggle`, `Checkbox`, `RadioButton`, `Slider`,
 * `ProgressIndicator`, and `ImageWidget`; and, since 2026-08-29 (RFC 0004),
 * `CanvasViewWidget` — with their §74 box model and layout,
 * their interaction flags, their §75 accessibility record, and whatever state
 * each control adds (checkedness, a group name, a range and its value, an image
 * key, a canvas view's device-pixel resolution — never its painted pixels,
 * §77a); the five drawing-tier node classes A-16 named, added 2026-08-07 —
 * §49's `Renderable`, §55's `Sprite`, §47's `PerspectiveCamera` and
 * `OrthographicCamera`, and §68's `DirectionalLight`
 * ({@link registerRenderSerializers}); `MotionComponent` (§11),
 * `KinematicController` (§12, added 2026-08-07) and the §44/§12 rig components
 * `OrbitRig`, `FollowRig` and `LookAtConstraint` (added 2026-08-13), through the
 * serializers `@four/motion` itself exports; and `RigidBody` and `Collider` (§23–§25),
 * through the pair `@four/physics` exports (`RIGID_BODY_SERIALIZER` /
 * `COLLIDER_SERIALIZER`, 2026-08-06 — the `PH-17` remainder) plus §12's
 * `SweptCharacterController` (`SWEPT_CHARACTER_CONTROLLER_SERIALIZER`,
 * 2026-08-21 — `PH-11b`). All three
 * packages declare their serializers against the same structural
 * `ComponentSerializer` shape, so registering them here adds no §3.1 edge
 * anywhere.
 *
 * That is **every** component class the engine ships — the eight with a
 * `static typeName`, counting `PoseTarget`, which `@four/serialization` seeds
 * itself. `tests/scene-serializers.test.ts` enumerates them off the umbrella's
 * own barrels and fails if one is missing, because an unregistered component
 * makes `serializeScene` throw (A-15) and the only sign of a new one being
 * forgotten would be an application that cannot save its scene.
 *
 * A scene carrying physics components therefore saves and reloads through this
 * one call, with no `{ unknownComponents: "skip" }` opt-out and nothing dropped
 * — see {@link registerPhysicsSerializers} for what a physics document does and
 * does not carry.
 *
 * The §79 **manifest document** (key → URL + content hash) ships in
 * `@four/assets`. `preloadManifestIntoCatalog` (this package) walks the keys
 * a document names, loads each, and returns a {@link SceneResourceCatalog}
 * whose `get` stays synchronous — deserialization cannot wait on a fetch.
 * The §80 `.four` binary package format is still untouched: none of this is
 * a format change (2026-08-07).
 *
 * ## Type names
 *
 * `<owning package>:<the section's own name for the class>`, kebab-cased:
 * `ui:panel` for `@four/ui`'s `Panel`, `render:sprite` for `@four/render`'s
 * `Sprite`, `scene:directional-light` for `@four/scene`'s `DirectionalLight`.
 * The prefix follows the `ui:*` precedent, which named the package rather than
 * the spec section — an application registering its own classes has a package
 * or vendor name (`com.example.thing`) and no section number, and `47:camera`
 * would be nobody's idea of readable.
 *
 * What the prefix does **not** promise is where the class will live forever:
 * spec revision 1.3 assigned cameras and viewports to `@four/scene` after the
 * fact, and a class that moves again keeps its type name regardless — these
 * constants are published API, and a document written by one build has to load
 * in the next. Read the prefix as a namespace, not as an import path.
 *
 * The two **unprefixed** names, `scene` and `group`, are `@four/serialization`'s
 * own built-ins and predate the convention. `scene` is a node type and `scene:`
 * is a namespace; the separator is what keeps them apart, and nothing in this
 * module writes a bare `scene`.
 *
 * ## Why a `Label`'s atlas is an option and not a payload
 *
 * A `GlyphAtlas` is a loaded resource, not scene state — §79 references
 * resources by logical key and stores none of them inline. So a label writes
 * its text, size, and letter spacing, and {@link SceneNodeTypeOptions.atlas}
 * supplies the face on the way back in. A document restored without one holds
 * labels that measure `0 × 0`, which is exactly what a `Label` with no atlas
 * is — not an error, and visible the moment anything lays it out.
 *
 * ## Geometry and material are references, not payloads (A-16, 2026-08-07)
 *
 * The same rule, one size up. §79 states it directly: *"assets are referenced
 * by logical key, resolved through a manifest that maps each key to a URL and
 * content hash (§76)"*. A `Renderable` **points at** a `BufferGeometry` and a
 * `Material` that it does not own and that hundreds of nodes may share (§83),
 * so the document carries **a key, not a copy**, and the application resolves
 * it on the way in exactly as it supplies a label's atlas.
 *
 * {@link SceneResourceCatalog} is that seam: a `keyOf` consulted on the way out
 * and a `get` consulted on the way in, injected through
 * {@link SceneNodeTypeOptions} the way `nodeDataOf` injects a writer. A catalog
 * built from a §76 manifest, from an asset bundle, or from a literal `Map` in a
 * test all satisfy it and none of the node types below can tell which — which
 * is the point: **the manifest sits behind this seam rather than replacing
 * it** — `preloadManifestIntoCatalog` is the walk that fills the map. A
 * `Map<string, Material>` already satisfies the read half on its own, since
 * `Map.get` *is* `get`; {@link resourceCatalog} builds both halves from one
 * map so they cannot disagree.
 *
 * A reference that cannot be **named** on the way out is refused, and so is one
 * that cannot be **resolved** on the way in (§85) — a `FourError` naming the
 * node and the key, never a silent substitution. `unknownResources: "skip"`
 * relaxes the *write* side only, writing `null` where the key would go, for the
 * inspector case `unknownComponents: "skip"` exists for; the resulting document
 * says out loud that it names no material, and loading it still throws.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no read-side `"skip"`**, and the asymmetry with
 * `unknownComponents` is the honest answer rather than an oversight. A node can
 * lose a component and still be that node; a `Renderable` cannot lose its
 * material and still be one — its constructor refuses to default either
 * argument precisely so the mistake is a type error rather than an invisible
 * node. A factory honouring `"skip"` would have to *invent* a geometry and a
 * material, handing the application a resource it never created and now owes a
 * `dispose()` to (§83). Refusing is the smaller lie.

 * reader that breaks the day a default changes. A document written before this

/**
 * The §79 node-type pair for the five classes a *drawn* scene is made of
 * (2026-08-07, the A-16 remainder): §49's `Renderable`, §55's `Sprite`, §47's
 * `PerspectiveCamera` and `OrthographicCamera`, and §68's `DirectionalLight`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const io = registerSceneNodeTypes({
 *   geometries: resourceCatalog([["geometry/plane", plane]]),
 *   materials: resourceCatalog([["material/brick", brick]]),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## What each one carries
 *
 * - **`Renderable`** — a `geometry` key, a `material` key (see the module
 *   header), `renderLayer`, `renderOrder`, `castShadow`/`receiveShadow` (§69,
 *   R-18), `frustumCulled` (§87, R-8) and `clip` (§67, R-23, 2026-08-28).
 *   §49's `depthMode` is still not
 *   written because the class does not have it yet; it joins the payload with
 *   the feature. (This bullet claimed all four were unwritten until
 *   2026-08-09 — it predated R-18.)
 * - **`Sprite`** — a `material` key, `width`, `height`, `anchor`,
 *   `renderLayer`, `renderOrder`, the same four drawable flags, and **no
 *   geometry key at all**: a sprite
 *   derives its quad from the anchor and the size and owns it (§55), so the
 *   payload above rebuilds it exactly. Its `dispose()` state is not written —
 *   a disposed sprite is a released resource, not authored scene state.
 * - **the cameras** — their projection parameters only. The three matrices are
 *   *derived*: `updateProjectionMatrix` rebuilds the projection from these
 *   numbers, and the view matrix from the node transform §79 already carries.
 *   The `depthRange` that projection was last built with is deliberately absent
 *   — it belongs to the renderer, not the camera (§47), so a document does not
 *   pin a scene to the backend that saved it.
 * - **`DirectionalLight`** — `color` and `intensity`. Its direction is its
 *   node's −Z axis (§68), which is the transform, not a payload.
 * - **`PointLight`** — `color`, `intensity`, and `range`. Its *position* is
 *   the node transform §79 already carries, so it is not a payload either
 *   (R-17, 2026-08-09).
 * - **`SpotLight`** — the point light's three, plus `innerConeAngle` and
 *   `outerConeAngle` in radians (§7a). Its axis is the node's −Z, like a
 *   directional light's: transform, not payload.
 *
 * A restored `Renderable` accepts **whatever material its key resolves to**;
 * only a `Sprite` insists on a `"sprite"` one. The asymmetry is the classes'
 * own: `Renderable<M extends Material>` is generic so that a consumer's own
 * material kind can be drawn through it, and refusing anything but
 * `"unlit"`/`"lit"` on the way in would make a legitimate
 * `Renderable<GlowMaterial>` savable and unloadable — while a `Sprite` takes a
 * `SpriteMaterial` and samples its texture, so any other kind is a run-time
 * type error that draws nothing.
 *
 * ## Why one pair and not three
 *
 * The cameras and the light live in `@four/scene` and the two drawables in
 * `@four/render`, so a package-shaped split is available and is not taken: the
 * split that pays is `@four/physics` versus the drawing tier (a headless
 * simulation saves scenes without bundling any of this — see
 * {@link registerPhysicsSerializers}), and *within* the drawing tier a scene
 * with a camera and a light is a scene that gets drawn. Splitting further would
 * hand callers a choice with no bundle behind it.
 *
 * Neither camera nor the light touches the resource options, so a caller with
 * no catalogs still gets all three; only a `Renderable` or `Sprite` reaching
 * the writer without one is refused (§85).
 *
 * Matched by **exact class identity**, like every other pair here: a subclass of
 * `Renderable` is not a `Renderable` for this purpose, and writing it out as one
 * would silently reload it as a plain renderable.
 *
 * @param options the resource catalogs and the unknown-resource policy
 * @returns the writer and reader halves; pass both or neither

/**
 * The §79 node-type pair for §50's shape family — the nine classes `R-23`
 * shipped on 2026-08-09 (`Circle`, `Ellipse`, `Rectangle`, `RegularPolygon`,
 * `Polygon`, `Star`, `Sector`, `Ring`, `PathShape`).
 *
 * ```ts
 * const io = registerSceneNodeTypes({
 *   materials: resourceCatalog([["material/ink", ink]]),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Separated from {@link registerRenderSerializers} for
 * {@link registerPhysicsSerializers}'s reason and no other: nine classes and
 * the §51 path parser behind `PathShape` are a real bundle unit, and a 3D or
 * UI application that saves scenes should not carry the 2D vector stack to do
 * it (§91). {@link registerSceneNodeTypes} calls this, so an application that
 * wants everything still makes one call.
 *
 * ## What a shape document carries
 *
 * A **material key** (see the module header — a shape points at a material it
 * does not own), the two ordering fields, §49's two shadow flags, the
 * flattening `tolerance`, §58's `fill` and `stroke`, and the shape's own
 * parameters. There is deliberately **no geometry key**: a shape *derives* its
 * fill and stroke from those parameters and owns the result (§83), exactly as a
 * `Sprite` derives its quad, so the payload rebuilds it exactly and a document
 * that named one would be naming a resource the application never created.
 *
 * A **paint-derived** shape (the §58 object tier, 2026-08-29) writes **no
 * material key**, for the geometry key's exact reason: its material is
 * derived from the paints the payload carries whole, and the reader
 * re-derives it. The one resource inside a paint — a pattern's texture —
 * travels as a logical key against {@link SceneNodeTypeOptions.textures}.
 *
 * ## §58 is additive in both directions (`R-16`, 2026-08-09; object tier 2026-08-29)
 *
 * `fill` and `stroke` are written **only when they differ from the class's own
 * default** — `"inherit"`/`null` for the nine closed primitives, `"none"` for
 * the three stroke-only ones. So a shape that names no paint writes the
 * byte-identical document `R-23` wrote, and a document written before §58
 * existed restores a fill-only shape with no field missing. A paint this
 * build cannot draw — an unknown kind (§58's conic, or a later build's), a
 * malformed object paint, or any object paint in a build that never called
 * `registerShapePaints()` — is **dropped rather than refused** wherever a
 * material key exists to fall back to: the shape reloads in that material's
 * colour, visible and recoverable, where refusing the node would lose the
 * artwork entirely. A paint-derived document has no such fallback, so there
 * the drop becomes a loud `FourError` naming the paint and the registration
 * call — inventing a material the document never named is the substituted
 * triangle again. A paint the material cannot draw at all is a different
 * matter and *is* refused, the way a `Sprite` whose material key resolves to
 * a lit one is.
 *
 * ## Two reading rules, and where the line between them is
 *
 * §96's rule is that data from outside is filtered rather than trusted, and the
 * A-12/R-18 precedent is that a corrupted field restores its default rather than
 * taking the whole scene down. That applies to every field the class itself
 * defaults — `tolerance`, `radius`, `width`, `height`, `rotation`, a
 * rectangle's corner radius, the ordering and shadow fields.
 *
 * The other rule covers the parameters a shape's constructor makes
 * **required**, because they *are* the shape: a regular polygon's side count, a
 * star's two radii, a sector's angles, a ring's hole, a polygon's points, a
 * path's commands. A document that does not carry one of those, carries one the
 * class would refuse, or carries a pair that contradicts itself, is refused
 * loudly with a `FourError` — the same answer {@link registerRenderSerializers}
 * gives a missing material key, and for the same reason: the alternative is to
 * invent a shape the document never described and hand it back as if it had.
 * A substituted triangle looks like a bug in the author's data; a refusal names
 * the node, the type, and the field.
 *
 * ## Arcs, and the one number that is not bit-exact
 *
 * §51's arc command stores a signed **sweep**; §51's builder — the only parse
 * that preserves the well-formedness every reader assumes, which is why `Path`
 * has no `fromCommands` — takes a start angle and an **end** angle. So an arc
 * is written as `[startAngle, endAngle]` and read back through `ellipse(…)`,
 * which recomputes the sweep. The recomputed sweep can differ from the original
 * by a few ulps when the start angle is large beside the sweep (measured: up to
 * 1.8e-15 rad over 200 000 samples), because `fl(fl(s + d) − s)` is not `d` in
 * general and no choice of end angle can make it one.
 *
 * Writing the **end** angle rather than the sweep is what keeps the *document*
 * exact anyway: `fl(s + arcSweep(s, e))` is `e` for every pair measured
 * (0 mismatches in 500 000), so a document round-trips byte for byte even
 * though the path's stored sweep may move in its last bit. Whole turns and zero
 * sweeps are exact in both, since `arcSweep` returns ±2π and 0 by early exit.
 * Nothing else in the family is affected: the eight parametric shapes store
 * their own parameters and restore them bit for bit.
 *
 * Matched by **exact class identity**, like every other pair here.
 *
 * @param options the material catalog and the unknown-resource policy
 * @returns the writer and reader halves; pass both or neither

 *   materials: resourceCatalog([["material/ink", ink]]),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## What a text document carries
 *
 * A `material` key, `text`, `size`, `letterSpacing`, `align`, `renderLayer`,
 * `renderOrder`, and the four drawable boolean flags — and **no geometry key**, for
 * `Sprite`'s reason: a `Text` derives its glyph quads from the four fields above
 * and owns them, so that payload rebuilds the geometry exactly.
 *
 * The **font is not in the document**, for the reason a `Label`'s is not
 * (module header): a `GlyphAtlas` is a loaded resource, and §79 references
 * resources rather than inlining them. It arrives through
 * {@link SceneNodeTypeOptions.atlas} — the option that already exists for
 * labels, reused rather than duplicated, so an application that draws both
 * passes one atlas and gets both back.
 *
 * ## Why a missing atlas is refused rather than defaulted
 *
 * A `Label` restored without an atlas measures `0 × 0`, which is what a label
 * with no atlas *is*. A `Text` has no such state: its constructor requires a
 * font, because there is no layout without one and no honest empty face to
 * substitute. So a document naming a text node loaded with no `atlas` option
 * throws, in the same voice and with the same fix-naming shape `resolveResource`
 * uses for an unresolvable material key. Inventing a
 * built-in face here would be worse than either: it would reload someone's
 * scene in a font they never chose and never asked about.
 *
 * ## Separated from the other pairs, and what that buys
 *
 * A pair of its own for {@link registerShapeSerializers}'s reason: registering
 * it is what pulls `Text` — and with it `@four/text`'s `layoutText` — into a
 * bundle, and an application whose scenes carry no text should not pay for the
 * layout engine to save one. {@link registerSceneNodeTypes} calls it, so an
 * application that wants everything still makes one call.
 *
 * Matched by **exact class identity**, like every other pair here.
 *
 * @param options the glyph atlas restored text nodes are given, and the §79
 * material catalog they resolve through
 * @returns the writer and reader halves; pass both or neither
