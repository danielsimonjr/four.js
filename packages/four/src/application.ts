/**
 * The `Application` composition root (§45, plan D4).
 *
 * §45's Application "owns the default scene, renderer, time system, simulation
 * scheduler, input routing, assets, diagnostics, cameras, and viewports". This
 * is the current subset of that object: the scene, the simulation scheduler,
 * the §39 system registry, the §48 viewport list, the §43 pose buffer, the
 * surface size ({@link Application.resize}), and — optionally — a §61 renderer,
 * wired together and re-emitting the §10 main-loop events.
 *
 * ## What §45 names, and where each of its members stands (A-6, 2026-08-08)
 *
 * The note that stood here through 2026-08-07 said the missing systems "arrive
 * with the phases that build them (§103)", and then — once every phase had
 * landed — that their absence was a gap. A-6 is that gap, closed member by
 * member. §45's sentence is that the Application "owns the default scene,
 * renderer, time system, simulation scheduler, input routing, assets,
 * diagnostics, cameras, and viewports", and its `ApplicationOptions` block
 * lists thirteen options. This is where each one ended up:
 *
 * | §45 names | here |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | scene, scheduler, time, cameras/viewports | {@link Application.scene}, {@link Application.scheduler}, {@link Application.time}, {@link Application.views} |
 * | `renderer`, `antialias`, `canvas`, `width`/`height`/`resolution` | R-2/A-8 and A-7, 2026-08-07 |
 * | `fixedTimeStep`, `maximumSubSteps` | the scheduler's, from construction |
 * | `physics` | {@link Application.physics} — a world, stepped at §39 step 6 |
 * | assets | {@link Application.assets} — §76's `app.assets.load(…)` |
 * | `autoResize` | {@link ApplicationOptions.autoResize}, through an injected {@link SurfaceObserver} |
 * | `reducedMotion` | {@link Application.reducedMotion} — §75's application-level policy |
 * | diagnostics | {@link Application.stats}, §84's named surface (A-1) |
 * | `alpha`, `powerPreference` | **refused**: `RendererOptions` (§61) carries neither, so accepting them would store values no backend reads |
 * | input routing | **refused**: see {@link ApplicationOptions.physics}'s neighbours below and the note under `assets` |
 *
 * The two refusals are the §40 precedent, not oversights: this repository does
 * not invent an API the specification declines to write. `alpha` and
 * `powerPreference` have nowhere to go. `app.input` has no shape — §45 names
 * "input routing" in prose, `ApplicationOptions` lists no input option, and no
 * example anywhere in the specification reads `app.input.*`, while `@four/input`
 * exposes two coequal subsystems (`PointerInput`, `KeyboardInput`) plus §75's
 * focus traversal; electing one of them to *be* `app.input` would be writing the
 * API §45 chose not to. `app.diagnostics` is the same case with one extra fact:
 * §84's application surface is spelled `app.stats` in the specification's own
 * example, and it ships.
 *
 * ## Why the composition root lives here
 *
 * Plan D4: `@four/motion`'s {@link Scheduler} is an event-free
 * `step(elapsedSeconds)` state machine and knows nothing about events, scenes,
 * or renderers; `@four/scene` knows nothing about time. The `four` umbrella
 * package is the one place that already depends on both, so it is where the
 * loop is *composed* — and §45 requires exactly that the wrapper be optional:
 * "The application must permit advanced users to construct and own these
 * systems independently rather than requiring the convenience wrapper." Every
 * part of this class is reachable separately (`new Scheduler`, `new Scene`,
 * `new SystemRegistry`, `resolveWorldTransforms`); `Application` only saves
 * you the wiring below.
 *
 * ## The wiring, and what it guarantees
 *
 * ```text
 * app.step(elapsed)
 *   └─ scheduler.step(elapsed)                       §10 accumulator
 *        ├─ onFixedStep  ×N   systems.runFixedStep(time)   §39 priority order
 *        │                      … incl. the pose snapshot  §39 step 10 / §43
 *        │                    emit("fixedUpdate", time)    §10 / §6b
 *        ├─ onUpdate          resolveWorldTransforms(scene) §7
 *        │                    emit("update", time)
 *        └─ onRender          emit("render", time)
 *                             renderer.render(scene, views, interpolation) §61
 * ```
 *
 * Four consequences worth stating, because tests pin all of them:
 *
 * 1. **Systems run before `fixedUpdate` listeners.** Registered systems are the
 *    engine's own simulation work (§39); an application listener observes the
 *    step *after* it has been simulated, never halfway through it.
 * 2. **World matrices are current when `update` fires.** §7 resolves world
 *    transforms once per fixed step (before physics synchronization) and once
 *    before render-item generation. Phase 1 has no physics synchronization
 *    point, so the single per-frame resolve sits at the top of `onUpdate`,
 *    which is before both the `update` and `render` listeners — the render pass
 *    of Phase 3 therefore already sees resolved matrices. When the physics
 *    adapter lands (§37), a second resolve is added inside the fixed step; that
 *    is a change to this file only.
 * 3. **`fixedUpdate` may fire zero or many times per `step`**, and `update` and
 *    `render` fire exactly once, always in that order — the §10 contract,
 *    inherited unchanged from the scheduler.
 * 4. **The draw is the last thing in the frame**, after the `render`
 *    listeners, so a listener can still move a camera or edit a viewport for
 *    the frame being drawn (§45; see `onRender` below).
 *
 * ## Headless by construction
 *
 * There is still no `requestAnimationFrame` driver and no DOM reference
 * anywhere in this file: {@link Application.start} flips state, and the host
 * calls {@link Application.step} with the elapsed seconds it chooses. That is
 * what makes determinism (§33) and replay (§34) testable — feed two
 * applications the same sequence and they produce identical event traces — and
 * a browser driver is a thin addition on top rather than something this class
 * has to be rescued from.
 *
 * The renderer does not change that. It arrives as an *instance* the
 * application author constructed (`renderer: new WebglRenderer()`), so this
 * module imports no backend even as a type at runtime, and an application
 * constructed without one behaves exactly as it did before renderers existed:
 * no renderer, no viewport list to draw, no snapshot system registered, and
 * an identical event trace (§33). Everything the renderer adds — the awaited
 * `initialize`, the per-frame draw, the §43 pose capture — is conditional on
 * that one option.

   *
   * §45 spells this option `"auto" | "webgpu" | "webgl2" | "canvas2d" | "svg"`,
   * and since 2026-08-01 this class took an instance instead, because
   * resolving a string to a class would mean `four` importing every backend
   * package at runtime: every program — the headless and determinism ones
   * included — would carry a WebGL renderer it never uses (§91; the deferral is
   * recorded in MEMORY, and the payload evidence was a 14.88 kB example).
   *
   * The string now works, and that reason is intact, because `four` still
   * imports no backend. A backend package registers itself into
   * `@four/render`'s §62 registry when the application asks it to, and the
   * string is resolved against whatever was registered:
   *
   * ```ts
   * import { registerWebglRenderer } from "@four/render-webgl";
   *
   * registerWebglRenderer();                    // the app names its backends
   * const app = new Application({ renderer: "auto", canvas, antialias: true });
   * await app.initialize();                     // resolves, then initializes
   * app.renderer;                               // the WebglRenderer, from here on
   * ```
   *
   * `"auto"` prefers WebGPU, then WebGL 2, then a 2D backend (§62), skipping
   * any that is unregistered, reports itself unsupported, or fails to
   * initialize — each skip reported through
   * {@link ApplicationOptions.onRendererFallback}. A named backend fails fast
   * with `RENDERER_INITIALIZATION_FAILED` (§62, §89) rather than downgrading,
   * and so does `"auto"` when nothing is left, naming every backend that *is*
   * registered (§85).
   *
   * Three consequences worth stating:
   *
   * 1. **{@link Application.renderer} is `null` until
   *    {@link Application.initialize} resolves** when a string is used — there
   *    is no renderer to hold before then. With an instance it is set at
   *    construction, exactly as before.
   * 2. **The registry initializes the renderer it built.** §62's fallback is
   *    defined in terms of `initialize` failing, so the selection has to be the
   *    one calling it; this class does not call it a second time.
   * 3. **Passing an instance stays fully supported**, and is what §45 requires
   *    ("the application must permit advanced users to construct and own these
   *    systems independently").
   *
   * The application **initializes** the renderer (see
   * {@link Application.initialize}) and **drives** it once per frame, but does

   * The §20/§37 world this application simulates (§45), or `false` (the
   * default) for an application with no physics at all.
   *

   *
   * ```ts
   * // The factory form. The application constructs the world, so it disposes it.
   * const app = new Application({
   *   physics: ({ poses }) =>
   *     new PhysicsWorld({ dimension: "3d", adapter: new Rapier3dAdapter(), poses }),
   * });
   * await app.initialize();          // awaits world.initialize() too
   * app.physics?.addBody(node);
   * ```
   *
   * ```ts
   * // The instance form. You constructed it, so you dispose it.
   * const world = new PhysicsWorld({ dimension: "2d", adapter });
   * const app = new Application({ physics: world });
   * ```
   *
   * ## Why a world and not §45's `PhysicsWorldOptions`
   *
   * §45 spells this option `PhysicsWorldOptions | false`, which would have this
   * class call `new PhysicsWorld(…)` and `new <solver>Adapter(…)` — and that is
   * the renderer's deferred string form again, with more at stake (R-2/A-8, and
   * MEMORY 2026-08-01). `four/application` would import `@four/physics`
   * statically, so **every** program that composes an application — the headless
   * ones, the determinism harness, the user-interface examples — would carry a
   * rigid-body world it never constructs. The renderer answer was a registry the
   * backend opts into; `@four/physics` has the same registry for solvers
   * (`registerSolver`, PH-19), but the world class itself has no such front
   * door, so the honest form today is the one §45's own closing sentence
   * requires anyway: "the application must permit advanced users to construct
   * and own these systems independently."
   *
   * ## What the application does with it
   *
   * 1. **Registers one {@link @four/motion!SimulationSystem | SimulationSystem}** at
   *    `PRIORITY_PHYSICS_SOLVE` (§39 step 6) that calls `world.step(fixedDeltaTime)`
   *    and then `world.dispatchEvents()` — the two passes, in the order
   *    `PhysicsSystem` runs them for a single world. This class cannot construct a
   *    `PhysicsSystem` (that is a runtime import of `@four/physics`, see above),
   *    so it registers the equivalent; **do not also track this world in a
   *    `PhysicsSystem`**, which would step it twice per fixed step and advance
   *    the simulation at double rate (§10, §34).
   * 2. **Initializes it** from {@link Application.initialize}, when
   *    `world.initialized` is still false — a WebAssembly solver loads its module
   *    there (§37), which is why that call is asynchronous.
   * 3. **Measures it**, when {@link ApplicationOptions.stats} is on: §84's
   *    `physicsStepTime` and `activeBodies`. See {@link Application.stats}.
   * 4. **Disposes it only if it built it** — the factory form. See
   *    {@link Application.dispose}.

   * ```
   *
   * ## Why this option exists at all
   *
   * §45's own option block did not list it, and the §40 packet's rule is that
   * adding an option §45 does not list is inventing API. RFC 0002's first open
   * question is exactly that collision, and the owner decided it (2026-08-21,
   * register row 5): **amend §45**. The precedent turned on `units` being
   * absent from the spec's own list *for §45*, whereas §81 is a spec section
   * that requires an install lifecycle and §45 owns the lifecycle — §81 has
   * nowhere else to live. Specification revision 1.9 records the amendment;
   * this option is the shipped form of it.
   *
   * ## Installation happens in `initialize`, and it must
   *
   * §81 types `install` as `void | Promise<void>`, so installation is
   * potentially asynchronous and cannot happen in a constructor.
   * {@link Application.initialize} installs the plugins **after** the renderer
   * and the physics world are ready, so a plugin's `install` sees a fully
   * constructed application. A refusal — a duplicate name, a missing
   * dependency, a dependency cycle, an engine-version mismatch, a capability
   * this host does not provide — rejects `initialize` and leaves the
   * application uninitialized, exactly as a failed renderer does.
   *
   * ## Which capabilities this host provides
   *
   * Two, and only two, because they are the only registries the application
   * itself holds:
   *
   * | Capability                                             | Provided |
   * | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
   * | `SIMULATION_SYSTEMS` (§39) — {@link Application.systems} | always |
   * | `RENDERER_REGISTRY` (§62) — {@link ApplicationOptions.rendererRegistry} | when that option was passed |
   *
   * A plugin needing a solver registry, a serializer registry, or a render
   * graph asks for something an `Application` never holds — naming those here
   * would put `@four/physics`, `@four/serialization`, and a `RendererRegistry`
   * in every bundle that composes an application, which is the cost this whole
   * file is written to avoid. Install such a plugin through a standalone
   * {@link @four/core!PluginHost | PluginHost}, providing the registries you
   * own; it takes three lines and is the form RFC 0002's §7 ships. Asking here
   * is refused loudly and by name, never ignored.
   *
   * Plugins are **values**, never names resolved from a document (§96). See
   * `@four/core`'s `plugin.ts` for the trust posture in full: a plugin runs
   * with the application's authority and nothing here sandboxes it.

   * resume, step, resize, dispose, and `resize` is the seventh of those eight).
   *
   * Three things happen, in this order:
   *
   * 1. the size is **recorded** ({@link Application.width} /
   *    {@link Application.height} / {@link Application.resolution}), so a
   *    headless application still knows how big it is;
   * 2. the renderer is told — `renderer.resize(width, height, resolution)`,
   *    which makes the drawing buffer `width · resolution` × `height ·
   *    resolution` device pixels and re-resolves every normalized viewport
   *    rectangle (§61);
   * 3. every **full-surface** viewport whose camera is a
   *    {@link PerspectiveCamera} has its `aspect` set to `width / height` and
   *    its projection rebuilt; every full-surface viewport whose camera
   *    instead accepts a surface size — §47's `ScreenCamera`, or any camera
   *    implementing `SurfaceSizedCamera` — is handed `(width, height,
   *    resolution)` and rebuilt too (R-37, 2026-08-21). That is how a
   *    screen-space UI pass learns its pixel rectangle; the push happens here
   *    rather than in the view loop because a projection should change when a
   *    *size* changes, not when a frame is drawn, and because a headless
   *    application (§45) never runs a view loop at all.
   *
   * **Why this class updates cameras and the renderer does not** (decision,
   * A-7; the sentence here quoted §61 until 2026-08-07 — "a camera's `aspect`
   * is the application's to set, because only the application knows which
   * camera belongs to which viewport" — and §61 says no such thing: it defines
   * `Renderer.resize(width, height, resolution)` and nothing about cameras. The
   * reasoning stands on its own and is restated as the decision it is). §47
   * gives the camera its projection and §48 maps one camera to one viewport
   * rectangle; a renderer is handed the finished `Viewport[]` and has no way to
   * know which of those rectangles a given camera was authored for. This class
   * is exactly that knowledge — {@link Application.views} is the mapping — so
   * the aspect update belongs here. §47 keeps projection recomputation
   * explicit, so the rebuild is a call to `updateProjectionMatrix`, made with
   * {@link ApplicationOptions.depthRange}.
   *
   * **Full-surface** means `normalized` with the rectangle `(0, 0, 1, 1)` —
   * what `createFullscreenViewport` builds. A partial viewport is left alone
   * because its aspect is its rectangle's, not the surface's, and the rectangle
   * may be in pixels the application maintains itself — a screen camera in a
   * partial viewport is sized with `setSurfaceSize` by whoever owns that
   * rectangle; an orthographic camera is left alone because its extent is an
   * authoring decision (how much world to show), not a consequence of the
   * window size.
   * Two viewports sharing one camera update it twice with the same value, which
   * is idempotent.
   *
   * **Headless is a no-op for step 2 only.** With no renderer the size is still
   * recorded and the cameras are still updated: a headless application that
   * feeds a custom draw path or takes a screenshot needs both, and "no
   * renderer" is not "no surface".
   *
   * Legal at any point in the lifecycle, including before `initialize` and
   * while stopped — a window resizes whether or not a frame is running. Not
   * legal after `dispose`.
   *
   * @param width surface width in logical pixels; finite and `>= 0`
   * @param height surface height in logical pixels; finite and `>= 0`
   * @param resolution device pixels per logical pixel; finite and `> 0`.
   * Defaults to the current value, so `app.resize(w, h)` after
   * `app.resize(w, h, 2)` keeps the 2× buffer rather than silently halving it.
   * @throws FourError if the application has been disposed
   * @throws RangeError if any argument is out of range

   * started again, and stepping it throws. The scene is deliberately **not**
   * destroyed: `Node` has no `dispose` (nothing yet holds a GPU or solver
   * resource on a node), and the scene may well outlive the application that

   * ownership follows construction, and an application that destroyed a
   * renderer it was merely lent would break the perfectly ordinary case of one
   * renderer outliving, or being shared between, applications. Disposing it is
   * one line at the same call site:
   *
   * ```ts
   * app.dispose();
   * renderer.dispose();

   * same reason — you constructed it.
   *
   * {@link Application.views} and {@link Application.poses} are left intact for
   * the same reason the scene is; the snapshot system that captured into the
   * buffer is disposed with every other registered system. An `autoResize`
   * subscription is released first of all, so no host report can reach a
   * half-torn-down application.
   *
   * The scheduler's callbacks are cleared *before* systems are disposed, so a
   * `dispose` that touches the scheduler cannot re-enter the loop or reach a
   * listener that has been told the application is gone. A system whose
