/**
 * The Rapier 2D solver adapter (§37, §102, plan WP-5.4).
 *
 * `Rapier2dAdapter` is a `PhysicsSolverAdapter` backed by
 * `@dimforge/rapier2d-compat` (pinned at `0.19.3` by plan P5-1). It is the first
 * concrete solver behind `@four/physics`'s stable API, and it may import
 * *nothing* from scene, motion, or render — the whole point of §37's seam is
 * that a solver knows about bodies and colliders and not about nodes.
 *
 * Everything below was written against the installed typings and verified
 * against the real wasm; the surprises worth knowing are called out in place
 * and summarized here:
 *
 * - **Rapier handles are not integers and not stable.** A `RigidBodyHandle` is
 *   a packed `(index, generation)` pair reinterpreted as a float — real observed
 *   values include `5e-324` and `2.12e-314`. They are usable as `Map` keys and
 *   nothing else, and destroying a body does not free its handle value for
 *   comparison purposes. §33 needs a *monotonic* order that destruction cannot
 *   perturb, so this adapter keeps its own registry — see
 *   {@link Rapier2dAdapter.forEachBody}.
 * - **Colliders are invisible to queries until the next `step`.** Rapier 0.19
 *   folded the query pipeline into the broad phase, which is updated inside
 *   `World.step`. `propagateModifiedBodyPositionsToColliders()` is *not* enough
 *   (verified). A collider created after the last step therefore cannot be hit
 *   by §30 queries until one step has run. The adapter does not paper over this
 *   with a hidden zero-length step, because that would run collision detection
 *   and manufacture events (§29) that no fixed step asked for.
 * - **Additional mass is applied late.** `RigidBodyDesc.setAdditionalMass` does
 *   not show up in `body.mass()` until the first `step` or an explicit
 *   `recomputeMassPropertiesFromColliders()`, and with zero-density colliders it
 *   yields **zero angular inertia**. See {@link Rapier2dAdapter.createBody} for
 *   how §23's "mass is authoritative" is honoured without that trap.
 * - **`world.step` integrates in `numSolverIterations` substeps** of
 *   `dt / numSolverIterations` (4 by default in 0.19.3). The discrete closed
 *   form for a free fall is therefore
 *   `y = y₀ + g · h² · K(K+1)/2` with `h = dt/4` and `K = 4N`, not the
 *   single-step semi-implicit form. Linear damping, by contrast, is applied
 *   once per **full** step as `v ← v / (1 + dt · damping)`. Both were measured,
 *   not assumed, and both are pinned by tests.
 *
 * ## Where the scene seam is (§37 `syncSceneToSolver` / `syncSolverToScene`)
 *
 * Both are **documented no-ops**. This is not laziness: Rapier applies every
 * write immediately — `setTranslation`, `setLinvel`, `applyImpulse` and friends
 * mutate solver state at the moment they are called — so there is no queue for
 * a flush point to flush. The adapter also cannot know what a "scene" is
 * (dependency rule: `physics-rapier` may not import `@four/scene`).
 *
 * What the physics package (WP-5.3) needs instead is a *per-handle* accessor
 * seam, and that is {@link RapierBodyAccess}: `PhysicsSystem` reads a body's
 * transform out of the solver and writes it onto its node under `"physics"`
 * authority (§42), and pushes kinematic targets and force commands back in. The
 * §37 call order is unchanged — `syncSceneToSolver` → `step` →
 * `syncSolverToScene` → `drainEvents` — the two sync calls simply have nothing
 * of their own to do for this solver.
 *
 * ## Events (§29, §6b)
 *
 * Collision, trigger, and sleep events are collected **inside `step`**, right
 * after `world.step`, and buffered; `drainEvents` hands over the buffer. That
 * ordering is forced by Rapier: the `EventQueue` is auto-drained at the start of
 * the next `step`, and contact manifolds (with their per-contact impulses) are
 * only meaningful immediately after the solve. No user callback is ever invoked
 * from here (§37).
 *
 * `collisionstay` **is** emitted by this adapter, even though Rapier has no such
 * event — see {@link Rapier2dAdapter.step} for how and why.
 *
 * ## Joints (§28, WP-6.2)
 *
 * The whole plan P6-1 planar tier is built — fixed, revolute, prismatic, rope,
 * spring — with limits and velocity motors on the two joints that have a driven
 * degree of freedom. Three awkward corners of Rapier 0.19.3's bindings are
 * declared rather than hidden, and each is verified against the wasm and not
 * only the typings:
 *
 * - **No joint reaction.** {@link Rapier2dAdapter.reportsJointReactions} is
 *   `false`, so `PhysicsWorld` refuses §28 break thresholds on this solver.
 * - **No motor force limit.** §28's `maxTorque`/`maxForce` becomes the motor's
 *   strength coefficient, not a ceiling — see
 *   {@link Rapier2dAdapter.setJointMotor} for exactly what it does mean.
 * - **No way to remove a motor**, and a gain of `0` is Rapier's *rigid* motor
 *   rather than its inert one. A disabled motor is therefore configured with
 *   `INERT_MOTOR_GAIN`, measured bit-identical to a joint that never had
 *   one — the same constant and the same answer `Rapier3dAdapter` gives.
 *
 * Joint handles, like body handles, are Rapier indices that get **reused** after
 * a removal, so the adapter keeps its own monotonic joint registry for §33's
 * ordering and carries it through the snapshot envelope.

 *
 * - `dimensions: ["2d"]` — this class wraps `@dimforge/rapier2d-compat`; the 3D
 *   build is a separate npm package and a separate adapter (WP-5.5).
 * - `jointTypes` — {@link RAPIER_2D_JOINT_TYPES}, the whole plan P6-1 planar
 *   tier (WP-6.2). Motors and limits ride on the revolute and prismatic types;
 *   §28 break thresholds do **not** work on this adapter, because Rapier
 *   0.19.3 reports no joint reaction — see
 *   {@link Rapier2dAdapter.reportsJointReactions}.
 * - `ccdModes` — all three. `"swept"` is Rapier's `RigidBodyDesc.setCcdEnabled`
 *   (motion clamping with `World.maxCcdSubsteps` substeps); `"speculative"` is
 *   `setSoftCcdPrediction` (predictive contacts, see
 *   {@link SOFT_CCD_PREDICTION_DISTANCE}); `"disabled"` is neither, and is
 *   always available.
 * - `determinism: "same-runtime"` — Appendix A's target and what Rapier's wasm
 *   gives here: the same build on the same engine reproduces a run exactly
 *   (proven by test). Nothing stronger is claimed: the wasm is compiled for a
 *   fixed float model, but this adapter's own conversions use JavaScript
 *   `Math.atan2`/`Math.sin`/`Math.cos`, whose results are not specified across
 *   engines, which is exactly what `"same-platform"` forbids.
 * - `snapshots: true` — `World.takeSnapshot` / `World.restoreSnapshot`, wrapped
 *   in an envelope that carries this adapter's registry too.
 * - `queries` — all four are implemented on Rapier's query entry points. See
 *   {@link Rapier2dAdapter.shapeCast} for the one multiplicity limit.
 * - `tuning` — **all four `false`** (2026-08-06; the fourth added 2026-08-08).
 *   §25's `rollingFriction` and
 *   `spinningFriction` have no binding in the 2D 0.19.3 build, and neither do
 *   §32's three sleeping thresholds (`IntegrationParameters` carries no
 *   sleeping member at all — enumerated at runtime, and the reason
 *   {@link Rapier2dAdapter.initialize}'s header says so). The declaration is
 *   what turns those from *accepted and dropped* into a warning `PhysicsWorld`
 *   prints once per world; `SleepingConfig.enabled` is honoured and is
 *   deliberately not part of it. `jointMotorEffortCap: false` is the odd one
 *   out (PH-22e): §28's `maxTorque`/`maxForce` is *not* dropped here, it is
 *   applied as a `ForceBased` strength gain rather than the hard ceiling §28
 *   describes — see {@link Rapier2dAdapter.setJointMotor}.

   * A `centerOfMass` or `inertiaTensor` **without** a `mass` is rejected:

   * A collider is a §23 mass contributor, so removing one changes the body's

   * list {@link Rapier2dAdapter.createCollider} reads to decide whether the

   *
   * - a `"first-collider"` body (an authored `mass` with no authored centre or
   *   tensor) whose mass-bearing collider was destroyed dropped to **zero
   *   mass** — Rapier leaves such a body motionless — and
   * - because the list still held one id, its replacement collider was created
   *   with `density: 0`, so the mass never came back.
   *
   * What happens now, in order: the id is dropped (in `#forgetCollider`, which
   * is also `destroyBody`'s path), then, for a surviving `"first-collider"`
   * body that still has colliders, the authored mass is re-applied to the
   * surviving collider with the **lowest monotonic id** (`Collider.setMass`,
   * §33-stable — creation order, unaffected by which collider died), and
   * finally the body's mass properties are recomputed so `getBodyMass` is
   * truthful before the next step, exactly as `createCollider` does.
   *
   * Re-applying rather than refusing the destruction is the honest option here:
   * §23 makes an authored mass authoritative for the *body*, not for whichever
   * collider happens to be holding it, and throwing would make "remove a
   * collider" fail on a body that has a perfectly good place to put its mass. A
   * body left with **no** collider keeps nothing — there is nowhere to hold it —
   * and gets its mass back from the next collider created on it, which is what
   * the corrected list now guarantees.
   *
   * **Not called when the body itself is going away** (2026-08-07):
   * `PhysicsWorld` tears a registration down with a single `destroyBody`, which
   * §37 defines as taking everything attached with it, so none of this runs for

   * | §28 type    | Rapier 2D call                                            |
   * | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
   * | `fixed`     | `JointData.fixed(a1, rotB − rotA, a2, 0)`                  |
   * | `revolute`  | `JointData.revolute(a1, a2)` — a plane has no axis (§21)   |
   * | `prismatic` | `JointData.prismatic(a1, a2, axis)`                        |
   * | `rope`      | `JointData.rope(maxLength, a1, a2)`                        |
   * | `spring`    | `JointData.spring(restLength, stiffness, damping, a1, a2)` |
   *
   * Two of those need explaining:
   *
   * - **The fixed joint's frames.** Rapier's fixed joint holds
   *   `rotA + frame1 == rotB + frame2`, so passing two zeroes would *snap* the
   *   bodies to a common orientation the moment the joint is created (measured:
   *   a body at `0.7 rad` is dragged to `0`). §28 says the bodies keep the
   *   relative pose they had, so `frame1` is the relative angle read out of the
   *   solver right now and `frame2` is zero — which holds the pose instead of
   *   changing it (measured: the same body stays at `0.7 rad`).
   * - **The revolute joint's axis.** Rapier 2D's revolute factory takes none,
   *   because §21 leaves one rotational degree of freedom. A descriptor may
   *   still name `−Z`, and the sign is kept: it mirrors the joint's limits and
   *   its motor rate rather than being dropped (see `revoluteAxisSignZ`).
   *
   * `collisionEnabled` maps to Rapier's `setContactsEnabled`, which is a real
   * per-joint switch (measured: two overlapping boxes tied by a slack rope push
   * each other apart with it on and stay overlapped with it off). Rapier's
   * default is contacts **on**; §28's default is off, so this method always
   * sets it explicitly.
   *
   * Limits and a motor are applied immediately after creation, through the same
   * code path {@link Rapier2dAdapter.setJointLimits} and
   * {@link Rapier2dAdapter.setJointMotor} use, so a joint created with a motor
   * and a joint reconfigured into one cannot drift apart.

   * ## It re-runs `createBody`'s mass-mode decision, deliberately
   *
   * `createBody` puts an authored mass in one of two places depending on what
   * else was authored (`resolveMassMode`): a bare `mass` goes onto the body's
   * **first collider** so Rapier still derives the centre and the inertia from
   * the geometry, while a `mass` with a centre or a tensor goes onto the
   * **body** as additional mass properties, with every collider zeroed out of
   * the derivation. This method makes exactly the same choice from the same
   * inputs and rewrites `BodyRecord.massMode`, so that `body.mass = 5` and
   * `removeBody` + `addBody` with `mass: 5` leave Rapier in the same state —
   * and so that a later `createCollider` or `destroyCollider` on this body
   * keeps making the right call about who carries the mass.
   *
   * A body with **no colliders** takes the body branch whatever was authored:
   * the first-collider branch would have nowhere to put the mass, and losing it
   * silently is what §23 forbids.
   *
   * `recomputeMassPropertiesFromColliders()` runs last for the reason
   * {@link Rapier2dAdapter.createBody} records: Rapier does not surface a mass
   * change in `mass()` until the next step otherwise, which would make
   * `getBodyMass` disagree with what was just written.

   * "motors"), and the one place this adapter's honest limitation lives.
   *
   * ## `maxEffort` is a gain here, not a clamp (decision, WP-6.2)
   *
   * Rapier 0.19.3's JavaScript bindings expose **no motor force limit**: the
   * whole motor surface is `configureMotorModel`, `configureMotorVelocity`,
   * `configureMotorPosition`, and `configureMotor`, and none of them takes a
   * maximum (verified against the wasm exports, not only the typings). What
   * they do take is a `factor`, which a measurement pins down exactly: in
   * Rapier's `ForceBased` model the motor exerts
   *
   * ```text
   * effort = factor · (targetVelocity − currentVelocity)
   * ```
   *
   * so `factor` is a damping coefficient in N·m·s/rad for a hinge and N·s/m for
   * a slider. This adapter passes §28's `maxTorque`/`maxForce` as that factor,
   * with `ForceBased` selected because §28 states the motor's strength as a
   * torque and a force (the `AccelerationBased` model divides the driven body's
   * inertia out, which would make the number mean something else again).
   *
   * The consequence, stated plainly: a bigger `maxTorque` is a stronger motor —
   * the monotone relationship §28 intends, and enough for the motor to reach
   * its commanded velocity — but it is **not** the hard ceiling §28 describes.
   * The motor's effort equals `maxTorque` at one rad/s (or one m/s) of velocity
   * error and exceeds it beyond that. No JavaScript-reachable Rapier API can
   * enforce the ceiling, and this adapter will not simulate one it does not
   * have.
   *
   * ## Disabling a motor (decision, WP-6.2-fix1)
   *
   * Rapier cannot *remove* a motor once one has been configured, and
   * `configureMotorVelocity(0, 0)` is not the way to switch one off: a zero
   * gain is Rapier's **rigid** zero-velocity constraint, a brake rather than a
   * release (measured: a bar turning at 3 rad/s falls to 0.294 rad/s in one
   * step and to 5.9e-44 rad/s within a second, where the same bar with no motor
   * keeps turning). A motor that arrives disabled — or whose `maxEffort` is
   * `0`, which asks for a drive that exerts nothing — is therefore configured
   * with `INERT_MOTOR_GAIN` and a zero target, the setting measured to be
   * **bit-identical** to a joint that never had a motor at all: `max |Δ| = 0`
   * over 3600 steps on a hinge and a slider, and over 600 steps continuing from
   * a joint that had just been running a strong motor. `Rapier3dAdapter` does
   * the same thing with the same constant, so a disabled motor means one thing
   * across this package.
   *
   * What that buys the caller: a running motor can be released, and the axis is
   * then as free as an unmotorized one. What it does *not* do is restore the
   * joint's pre-motor history — the body keeps whatever velocity the motor gave
   * it and coasts from there, which is what releasing a drive means.
