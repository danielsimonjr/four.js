/**
 * The Rapier 3D solver adapter (§37, §102, plan WP-5.5).
 *
 * `Rapier3dAdapter` is a `PhysicsSolverAdapter` backed by
 * `@dimforge/rapier3d-compat` (pinned at `0.20.0`). It is the 3D
 * sibling of {@link Rapier2dAdapter} and obeys the same rule: it may import
 * *nothing* from scene, motion, or render, because §37's seam exists so a solver
 * knows about bodies and colliders and not about nodes.
 *
 * ## Relationship to the 2D adapter
 *
 * The two classes are deliberately parallel and deliberately **separate**. They
 * wrap different npm packages with different wasm images and different call
 * signatures — 3D rotations are quaternions, 3D angular velocity and torque are
 * vectors, 3D inertia is three principal moments plus a frame — so the shared
 * part is the *shape* of the code, not the code itself. Every attempt to unify
 * them would have to be generic over the vector width and the rotation
 * representation, which is precisely the distinction that matters. What *is*
 * shared is the seam: `Rapier3dAdapter` implements the same
 * {@link RapierBodyAccess} interface the 2D adapter declares, unchanged — see
 * below.
 *
 * ## Rapier behaviour verified for 3D (not assumed from the 2D packet)
 *
 * Every finding WP-5.4 recorded for the 2D build was re-measured against the 3D
 * build for this packet, and all of them hold:
 *
 * - **Rapier handles are not integers and not stable.** Observed 3D values
 *   include `0`, `4.94e-324`, and `2.12e-314` — a packed `(index, generation)`
 *   pair reinterpreted as a float. They are usable as `Map` keys and nothing
 *   else. §33 needs a *monotonic* order that destruction cannot perturb, so this
 *   adapter keeps its own registry — see
 *   {@link Rapier3dAdapter.forEachBody}.
 * - **Colliders are invisible to queries until the next `step`.** A ray cast at
 *   a freshly created collider misses; `propagateModifiedBodyPositionsToColliders()`
 *   does not help; one `step` fixes it. The adapter does not paper over this
 *   with a hidden zero-length step, because that would run collision detection
 *   and manufacture events (§29) that no fixed step asked for.
 * - **Additional mass is applied late.** `setAdditionalMassProperties` leaves
 *   `body.mass()` at `0` until the first `step` or an explicit
 *   `recomputeMassPropertiesFromColliders()`. See
 *   {@link Rapier3dAdapter.createBody}.
 * - **`world.step` integrates in `numSolverIterations` substeps** of
 *   `dt / numSolverIterations` (4 by default in 0.19.3, same as 2D). The
 *   discrete closed form for a free fall is therefore
 *   `y = y₀ + g · h² · K(K+1)/2` with `h = dt/4` and `K = 4N`. Measured against
 *   the closed form over 60 steps: 4.3e-7 of drift.
 * - **A capsule's cylindrical section lies along +Y**, matching §24; a capsule
 *   with `halfHeight = 1, radius = 0.25` rests at `y = 1.2489`.
 * - **`castShape` reports `witness1` in world space and `witness2` in the cast
 *   shape's local frame** — measured, and the reason only `witness1` is used.
 * - **`projectPoint(point, solid: true)` returns the query point itself** when
 *   the point is inside a plain shape, and the surface projection otherwise.
 * - **Sensors are included in queries by default**, which is why §30's
 *   `includeSensors` is applied by `passesQueryFilter` rather than left to
 *   Rapier.
 * - **`ActiveCollisionTypes.DEFAULT` excludes kinematic-vs-fixed** (`DEFAULT` is
 *   15, `ALL` is 60943): a fixed sensor saw zero events from a kinematic body
 *   until `ALL` was set, and two afterwards.
 * - **`version()` throws before `init()`**, and **`IntegrationParameters`
 *   exposes no sleeping thresholds** (its members are `dt`, `contact_erp`,
 *   `lengthUnit`, `normalizedAllowedLinearError`, `normalizedPredictionDistance`,
 *   `numSolverIterations`, `numInternalPgsIterations`, `minIslandSize`,
 *   `maxCcdSubsteps`, `contact_natural_frequency`).
 * - **`World` retains the gravity object it is constructed with** and reads it
 *   every step, so this adapter hands it a fresh literal rather than a scratch
 *   buffer.
 * - **`InteractionGroups` is one `u32`**, 16 bits of membership and 16 of
 *   filter, exactly as in 2D.
 * - **Descriptor setters copy.** `RigidBodyDesc.setRotation`, `setAngvel`, and
 *   `setAdditionalMassProperties` copy their arguments rather than retaining
 *   them (measured), which is what lets the conversions below write into reused
 *   scratch records. `Ray`, by contrast, *does* retain its `origin` and `dir`,
 *   so ray casts build fresh literals.
 *
 * ## Where the scene seam is (§37 `syncSceneToSolver` / `syncSolverToScene`)
 *
 * Both are **documented no-ops**, for the same reason as in 2D: Rapier applies
 * every write immediately, so there is no queue for a flush point to flush, and
 * the adapter cannot know what a "scene" is.
 *
 * What the physics package (WP-5.3) needs instead is a *per-handle* accessor
 * seam, and that is `RapierBodyAccess`, declared in `rapier2d-adapter.ts`. That
 * module says the interface may be promoted into `@four/physics` "once the 3D
 * adapter (WP-5.5) has confirmed the shape is dimension-independent". **It is.**
 * This class implements it verbatim — same method names, same signatures, no
 * additions and no omissions — and imports the type rather than restating it, so
 * the two adapters cannot drift. The only reading that changes with the
 * dimension is what the values *mean*: `outRotation` receives a full
 * orientation rather than a pure-Z quaternion, and the angular `Vector3`s are
 * genuine three-axis quantities rather than Z-only ones. Both are already what
 * the interface's types say.
 *
 * ## Events (§29, §6b)
 *
 * Collision, trigger, and sleep events are collected **inside `step`**, right
 * after `world.step`, and buffered; `drainEvents` hands over the buffer. That
 * ordering is forced by Rapier: the `EventQueue` is auto-drained at the start of
 * the next `step`, and contact manifolds (with their per-contact impulses) are
 * only meaningful immediately after the solve. No user callback is ever invoked
 * from here (§37).
 *
 * `collisionstay` **is** emitted by this adapter, derived from a touching-pair
 * map exactly as in 2D — see {@link Rapier3dAdapter.step}.
 *
 * ## Joints (§28, §37; plan P6-1, WP-6.3)
 *
 * This adapter builds all six shipped 3D joint types and implements
 * `SolverJointAccess`, which is what lets `PhysicsWorld.addJoint` accept it.
 * Everything below was **measured against the installed
 * `@dimforge/rapier3d-compat@0.19.3`** — the typings *and* the wasm — on
 * 2026-08-01, not read off documentation. Four findings shape the mapping, and
 * three of them are gaps that are declared rather than papered over:
 *
 * 1. **Rapier reports no joint reaction.** Neither `ImpulseJoint` nor
 *    `RawImpulseJointSet` has a single member matching `impulse`, `reaction`,
 *    `force`, or `torque` (both prototypes enumerated at runtime; the raw set
 *    offers anchors, frames, body handles, contacts-enabled, limits, and the
 *    four `jointConfigureMotor*` entry points, and nothing else). Plan P6-2's
 *    break thresholds therefore cannot be enforced on this solver, so
 *    {@link Rapier3dAdapter.reportsJointReactions} is `false` and
 *    {@link Rapier3dAdapter.getJointReaction} throws `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`. A world
 *    refuses a breakable joint on this adapter instead of accepting a threshold
 *    that would never fire — breakage is staged, dated, and not faked.
 * 2. **A spherical joint has no limits, and per-axis angular limits are not a
 *    cone.** `SphericalImpulseJoint` is not a `UnitImpulseJoint`: it exposes
 *    neither `setLimits` nor `configureMotor*` (verified —
 *    `typeof joint.setLimits === "undefined"`). The only other route is the raw
 *    set's `jointSetLimits(handle, RawJointAxis, min, max)`, which *does* accept
 *    the angular axes — and does not produce a cone. Measured on a ball joint
 *    limited to ±0.3 rad on every angular axis: a swing in a single plane stops
 *    at 0.2998 rad (correct), but a **diagonal** swing reaches **1.1247 rad**,
 *    almost four times the requested half-angle. A cone built that way would be
 *    a wrong simulation, so {@link Rapier3dAdapter.createJoint} **throws
 *    `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`** for a `spherical` descriptor carrying `limits`, and
 *    builds the unlimited ball joint otherwise. `SphericalJointLimits` says
 *    WP-6.3 "verifies that against Rapier and reports honestly if it cannot be
 *    built"; this is that report.
 * 3. **A motor has no effort cap.** `configureMotorVelocity(targetVel, factor)`
 *    forwards to `jointConfigureMotor(handle, axis, targetPos, targetVel,
 *    stiffness, damping)`, and there is **no** `maxForce` anywhere in the JS or
 *    wasm binding. Rapier's `factor` is the motor's *damping gain*: the effort
 *    it applies is proportional to the velocity error, `≈ factor · (targetVel −
 *    currentVel)` under `MotorModel.ForceBased`. §28's `maxTorque`/`maxForce`
 *    is passed as that gain (see {@link Rapier3dAdapter.setJointMotor}), which
 *    makes a stronger motor stronger — measured: a shaft commanded to 4 rad/s
 *    settles at 3.60 rad/s with a gain of 0.1 and at exactly 4 rad/s from a gain
 *    of 1 upwards — but it is **not** the hard cap the field's name promises.
 *    Documented here rather than hidden, and flagged for a later decision.
 * 4. **A motor gain of exactly zero makes the motor rigid.** With
 *    `stiffness = 0` and `damping = 0` Rapier drives the joint to the target
 *    velocity *exactly* (measured: a loaded arm commanded to 3 rad/s reached
 *    2.91 rad/s with a gain of `0`, against 2.99 with a gain of `0.1`), which is
 *    the opposite of what a zero effort cap means. A disabled motor, or one
 *    whose `maxEffort` is `0`, is therefore configured with
 *    `INERT_MOTOR_GAIN` instead — a gain small enough that the motorized
 *    arm's trajectory is *bit-identical* to the same arm with no motor at all
 *    (verified). That is the only honest reading of "a disabled motor exerts
 *    nothing", because Rapier has no way to *remove* a motor once one is set.
 *
 * The parts that map cleanly, each verified by a test in
 * `tests/rapier3d-joints.test.ts`:
 *
 * - `JointData.fixed(anchor1, frame1, anchor2, frame2)` — 3D fixed joints take
 *   two **quaternion frames**, unlike 2D's scalar angles, and Rapier welds the
 *   bodies so that `q₁·frame1` and `q₂·frame2` coincide. Passing the identity
 *   for both would snap the bodies to a *shared* orientation; §28 says they keep
 *   the relative pose they had at creation, so this adapter passes `frame1 =
 *   identity` and `frame2 = conj(q₂)·q₁`, read off the solver's own poses at
 *   `createJoint`. Measured: a lever rotated 90° about +Z keeps its 90° with the
 *   derived frame and is snapped to 0° with the identity one.
 * - `JointData.revolute(anchor1, anchor2, axis)` /
 *   `JointData.prismatic(anchor1, anchor2, axis)` — **one** axis for both
 *   bodies, which is Rapier's model, not a simplification made here: the
 *   descriptor's `bodyA`-local axis is used as each body's local axis, so two
 *   bodies that are not co-oriented at creation will be aligned by the solver.
 *   Pose the mechanism before adding the joint, which `joints.ts` already says.
 * - `JointData.rope(length, anchor1, anchor2)` — measured: a rope of
 *   `maxLength = 1.5` holds the anchors at 1.500000 m and never further.
 * - `JointData.spring(restLength, stiffness, damping, anchor1, anchor2)` —
 *   measured: a 1 kg bob on `k = 100 N/m` oscillates with a period of 0.62879 s
 *   against the closed form's 0.62832 s (0.07%), and `c = 20 N·s/m` is exactly
 *   the critical damping `2√(km)` the closed form predicts.
 * - `JointData.spherical(anchor1, anchor2)` — three swing degrees of freedom;
 *   measured against a revolute joint on the same rig, the ball swings in both
 *   the XZ and XY planes where the hinge swings in one.
 * - `UnitImpulseJoint.setLimits(min, max)` on revolute and prismatic joints
 *   only, live and after creation; measured to clamp a hinge at its bound
 *   (−0.5043 rad against a −0.5 limit, one solver iteration of overshoot).
 * - Joint state **survives `World.takeSnapshot`/`restoreSnapshot`**: handles,
 *   limits, and motors all come back, and 60 further steps reproduce the
 *   original continuation exactly (max |Δx| = 0). The envelope carries this
 *   adapter's joint registry beside them — see
 *   {@link Rapier3dAdapter.createSnapshot}.
 * - `World.removeRigidBody` **removes the joints attached to that body**
 *   (measured: the joint set empties), so {@link Rapier3dAdapter.destroyBody}
 *   forgets their records rather than leaving handles pointing at nothing.

/**
 * What this adapter can actually do (§37), field by field:
 *
 * - `dimensions: ["3d"]` — this class wraps `@dimforge/rapier3d-compat`; the 2D
 *   build is a separate npm package and a separate adapter.
 * - `jointTypes` — every one of plan P6-1's six shipped types, which in a
 *   `"3d"` world is all of them (`SHIPPED_JOINT_TYPES_3D`), listed literally so
 *   that a later widening of the engine's tier cannot silently enrol this
 *   adapter in a type it does not build. Two caveats live in the joint section
 *   of the module header rather than in this list, because `jointTypes` is
 *   `string[]` (§37) and has nowhere to put them: a `spherical` joint ships
 *   **without** limit support (a limited one is refused, loudly), and a motor's
 *   `maxTorque`/`maxForce` reaches Rapier as a gain rather than as a cap.
 * - `ccdModes` — all three. `"swept"` is Rapier's `RigidBodyDesc.setCcdEnabled`
 *   (motion clamping with `World.maxCcdSubsteps` substeps); `"speculative"` is
 *   `setSoftCcdPrediction` (predictive contacts, see
 *   {@link SOFT_CCD_PREDICTION_DISTANCE}); `"disabled"` is neither, and is
 *   always available. Both entry points exist in the 3D build (verified).
 * - `determinism: "same-runtime"` — Appendix A's target and what Rapier's wasm
 *   gives here: the same build on the same engine reproduces a run exactly
 *   (proven by test). Nothing stronger is claimed: this adapter's own
 *   conversions use JavaScript `Math.sin`/`Math.cos` (for the scalar-angle
 *   rotation form), whose results are not specified across engines, which is
 *   exactly what `"same-platform"` forbids.
 * - `snapshots: true` — `World.takeSnapshot` / `World.restoreSnapshot`, wrapped
 *   in an envelope that carries this adapter's registry too.
 * - `queries` — all four are implemented on Rapier's query entry points. See
 *   {@link Rapier3dAdapter.shapeCast} for the one multiplicity limit.
 * - `tuning` — **all four `false`** (2026-08-06; the fourth added 2026-08-08),
 *   for the same reasons the 2D adapter declares: no rolling or spinning
 *   friction binding in the 3D 0.19.3 build, and no sleeping thresholds
 *   anywhere in `IntegrationParameters` (enumerated at runtime — see this
 *   header's §32 note). `PhysicsWorld` turns the declaration into a
 *   once-per-world warning when such a value is authored;
 *   `SleepingConfig.enabled` *is* honoured and is not part of it.
 *   `jointMotorEffortCap: false` is the odd one out (PH-22e): §28's
 *   `maxTorque`/`maxForce` is *not* dropped here, it is applied as a
 *   `ForceBased` strength gain rather than the hard ceiling §28 describes —
 *   see {@link Rapier3dAdapter.setJointMotor}.

   * the colliders contribute. §23 says `mass` is authoritative, so the adapter

   * this body honours it. In particular, an explicit `mass` with no inertia
   * tensor is carried by the body's *first* collider through
   * `ColliderDesc.setMass`, which gives the requested mass **and** a
   * geometry-derived inertia tensor — measured: a unit cube at `setMass(7)`
   * reports mass 7 and principal inertia (1.1667, 1.1667, 1.1667).
   *
   * The 3D-only wrinkle is the inertia tensor. Rapier wants three principal
   * moments plus the frame they are expressed in, where §23 offers a full
   * `Matrix3`; `toPrincipalInertia3d` accepts a **diagonal** tensor (exact, with
   * the identity frame) and rejects anything else rather than guessing. See its
   * documentation for why an eigendecomposition was not the right answer for
   * this phase.
   *
   * A `centerOfMass` or `inertiaTensor` **without** a `mass` is rejected:
   * Rapier can only set the whole quadruple, and silently dropping the one the
   * caller did supply is the kind of quiet substitution §85 exists to prevent.

   * have no Rapier 3D binding at 0.19.3 and cannot be applied here — declared
   * in `capabilities.tuning`, so a `PhysicsWorld` registering a collider that
   * carries one warns rather than dropping it in silence (2026-08-06).
   *
   * `collisionGroups`/`collisionMask` are packed into Rapier's single
   * `InteractionGroups` word; `sensor` sets the sensor flag *and* widens
   * `ActiveCollisionTypes` to `ALL`, because Rapier's default excludes
   * kinematic-vs-fixed and fixed-vs-fixed pairs — a static trigger volume would
   * otherwise never notice a kinematic character walking through it (verified in
   * 3D, and a §29 requirement rather than a preference). Solid colliders keep
   * Rapier's default, where those pairs are genuinely uninteresting.
   *
   * `ActiveEvents.COLLISION_EVENTS` is enabled on every collider: §29's five
   * event names are part of the engine's contract, not an opt-in.
   * `CONTACT_FORCE_EVENTS` is deliberately **not** enabled — the contact
   * manifolds read in `step` carry per-contact impulses, which is strictly more
   * information than a contact-force event's summed force and needs no
   * threshold to be configured.

   * Rapier 0.19.3's JavaScript bindings have **no motor force limit**:
   * `configureMotorVelocity(targetVelocity, factor)` reaches
   * `jointConfigureMotor(handle, axis, targetPos, targetVel, stiffness,
   * damping)` and there is no `maxForce` parameter anywhere in the typed or raw
   * surface (verified 2026-08-01 — see finding 3 in the module header).
   * `SolverJointMotor.maxEffort` is therefore passed as Rapier's **damping
   * gain**: the effort the motor applies is roughly `maxEffort × (targetVelocity
   * − currentVelocity)` under `MotorModel.ForceBased`, so a larger `maxEffort`
   * is a stronger motor, but the number is a gain and not the cap its name
   * promises. A motor commanded to 4 rad/s settles at 3.60 rad/s with a gain of
   * 0.1 and reaches exactly 4 rad/s from a gain of 1 upwards (measured).
   *
   * `MotorModel.ForceBased` is chosen over `AccelerationBased` because §28
   * states the cap in newton-metres and newtons: a force-based motor's effort
   * is what the units describe, where an acceleration-based one scales with the
   * body's inertia.
   *
   * A motor that is disabled, or whose `maxEffort` is `0`, is configured with
   * `INERT_MOTOR_GAIN` and a zero target instead of being removed —
   * Rapier cannot remove a motor, and a gain of exactly `0` is its *rigid* case
   * rather than its inert one. The inert gain reproduces an unmotorized joint
   * bit for bit (measured).

   * Fills a §29 contact manifold from Rapier's narrow phase.
   *
   * Every field is taken from Rapier where Rapier has it, and the two it does
   * not are documented rather than faked:
   *
   * - `pointOnA` / `pointOnB` — `localContactPoint1/2` transformed by each
   *   collider's world isometry, which in 3D means a quaternion rotation
   *   followed by a translation (`rotateVectorByRotation3`). Rapier's manifold
   *   may be *flipped* relative to the pair as this adapter names it; the
   *   `flipped` flag is honoured so `pointOnA` is always on `colliderA`.
   * - `normal` — the manifold's world-space normal, negated when flipped so it
   *   always points **from A towards B**, as `ContactPoint` requires.
   * - `separation` — `contactDist`, negative while interpenetrating.
   * - `impulse` — `contactImpulse`, the normal impulse the solver applied at
   *   that point during the step, in newton-seconds.
   * - `totalImpulse` — the sum of those impulses along the normal, which is
   *   what `CONTACT_FORCE_EVENTS` would report without needing a force
   *   threshold configured per collider.
   * - `relativeVelocity` — **computed by this adapter**, not reported by Rapier:
   *   the difference of the two bodies' velocities at the first contact point,
   *   read *after* the solve. It is therefore the post-impact relative velocity,
   *   not the approach velocity; scale impact responses by `totalImpulse`,
   *   which is the quantity the solver actually applied. Zero when the pair has
   *   no contacts.
