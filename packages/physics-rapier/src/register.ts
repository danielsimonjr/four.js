/**
 * This package's opt-in to §37's solver registry (PH-19).
 *
 * `@four/physics` holds the registry and knows no solver; this module is the
 * one place that names both, and it lives here — below the stable API, above
 * nothing — because that is the only direction the frozen §3.1 matrix allows
 * (`physics-rapier` already depends on `physics`; no edge is added).
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { registerRapierSolver } from "@four/physics-rapier";
 *
 * registerRapierSolver();
 * const world = new PhysicsWorld({ dimension: "3d", solver: "auto" });
 * await world.initialize();
 * ```
 *
 * ## One registration, both §21 dimensions
 *
 * Rapier ships as two npm packages with two wasm images and this package wraps
 * each in its own adapter, but §37 selects a *solver*, not a build: `"rapier"`
 * is one name, and the dimension is a property of the world asking. So the
 * single registration's `create` reads `options.dimension` and constructs
 * {@link Rapier2dAdapter} or {@link Rapier3dAdapter} accordingly — which is
 * exactly the capability-driven choice §37 describes, made at the only point
 * where the answer is known.
 *
 * Neither wasm image is loaded here. A constructor allocates nothing but the
 * adapter; `PhysicsWorld.initialize` awaits `adapter.initialize`, and that is
 * where `init.ts`'s per-dimension load happens — so registering both
 * dimensions still decodes only the one a world actually uses.
 *
 * ## Why this is a function call and not an import side effect
 *
 * `@four/physics-rapier` declares `"sideEffects": false`, so a bundler may
 * delete an import whose bindings are unused; a side-effect registration
 * module would be dropped and `solver: "auto"` would then fail at runtime with
 * "nothing is registered". `@four/render`'s `renderer-registry.ts` carries the
 * full argument — this is the same decision, taken once for both tiers.
 *
 * The module is separate from the adapters for the mirror-image reason: a
 * program that constructs `new Rapier3dAdapter()` itself must not pay for the
 * registry, and a module it never imports costs it nothing.

 * no `WebAssembly` global — an old engine, or a host that has removed it under
