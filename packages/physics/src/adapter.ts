/**
 * The solver adapter contract (§37) — the seam every physics backend
 * implements.
 *
 * §20's promise is that "users should not need to write solver-specific
 * application code for common tasks". This interface is how that promise is
 * kept: `@four/physics` is the stable API, and a concrete engine — Rapier,
 * Box2D, or a bespoke engineering solver — reaches it only through
 * {@link PhysicsSolverAdapter}. Nothing above this line names a solver type,
 * which is what lets the solver be swapped, compared against another, or left
 * out entirely.
 *
 * The interface below is §37's, member for member, with its abstract type names
 * bound to this package's concrete ones. Two shapes depart from §37's literal
 * text, both deliberately:
 *
 * - **`readonly` capability fields.** §37 writes `jointTypes: string[]`;
 *   {@link PhysicsCapabilities} makes the arrays and fields `readonly`. An
 *   adapter publishes its capabilities once and callers only read them — the
 *   same treatment `RendererCapabilities` (§62) got in `@four/render`, and for
 *   the same reason: a capability set that could be edited after negotiation
 *   would make the negotiation meaningless.
 * - **Handles are opaque.** §37's `PhysicsBodyHandle` and friends are named but
 *   not defined; `types.ts` makes them branded, unforgeable types. An adapter
 *   casts its own solver object to one and back; nobody else can.
 * - **One additive capability field.** §37 lists six; {@link
 *   PhysicsCapabilities} carries an optional seventh, `tuning`, because §25's
 *   rolling/spinning friction and §32's sleeping thresholds are accepted by the
 *   stable API and honoured by no shipped solver. The field makes that visible
 *   instead of silent (see {@link PhysicsTuningCapabilities}); it adds no
 *   requirement to an adapter that never declares it.
 *
 * ## The call order the physics package guarantees (§37, §39)
 *
 * Per fixed step, and never in another order:
 *
 * 1. {@link PhysicsSolverAdapter.syncSceneToSolver} — scene-authored state goes
 *    in: kinematic targets, teleports, property changes.
 * 2. {@link PhysicsSolverAdapter.step} — the solver advances by one fixed
 *    delta.
 * 3. {@link PhysicsSolverAdapter.syncSolverToScene} — solved transforms come
 *    back out.
 * 4. {@link PhysicsSolverAdapter.drainEvents} — the step's contacts, triggers,
 *    and sleep transitions are collected, normalized (§101), and dispatched
 *    **after** the step (§6b, §29, §39 step 9).
 *
 * The pre-step body pose is retained by the physics package as the "previous"
 * pose for §43 render interpolation; interpolated poses are presentation-only
 * and are never written back into the solver (§43).
 *
 * ## What an adapter must never do
 *
 * - **Never invoke user callbacks** (§37). Events are returned from
 *   `drainEvents` and dispatched by the physics package, so a listener can
 *   safely create and destroy bodies without re-entering a running solver.
 * - **Never read the wall clock or `Math.random`** in the simulation path
 *   (§33). Time arrives as `step`'s argument; randomness comes from a seeded
 *   generator.
 * - **Never iterate in an order that is not insertion order** where that order
 *   can reach a result (§33).
 *
 * This module is types only — it ships no runtime code. The structural test
 * double that proves the interface is implementable is `FakeSolverAdapter`
 * (WP-5.3), alongside the world that drives it.
