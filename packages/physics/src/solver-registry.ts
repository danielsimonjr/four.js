/**
 * The §37 solver registry — how `solver: "auto"` becomes an adapter without
 * `@four/physics`, or the `four` umbrella, ever importing a solver (PH-19).
 *
 * §37 says *"capability declarations drive `solver: "auto"` selection (§20)"*,
 * and §45's application options show the shape a user writes:
 * `physics: { solver: "rapier", dimension: "3d" }`. What §20 has said since
 * revision 1.7 is why it did not exist: *"the world takes an adapter instance;
 * the `solver: "auto"` string form of §37's capability-driven selection is
 * deferred to the same registry work as `renderer: "auto"` (§97a)."*
 *
 * This is that work, and it is the exact mirror of `@four/render`'s
 * `renderer-registry.ts` — deliberately, because the two affordances were
 * filed as one design (gap analysis `A-8` / `R-2` / `PH-19`). Read that module
 * first: everything it says about why the dependency is inverted, why
 * registration is an explicit call and never an import side effect, and why
 * {@link resolveSolver} does not mention {@link SolverRegistry}, applies here
 * word for word. The §3.1 matrix is untouched: `physics-rapier` already
 * depends on `physics`, and nothing here names a solver.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { registerRapierSolver } from "@four/physics-rapier";
 *
 * registerRapierSolver();
 * const world = new PhysicsWorld({ dimension: "3d", solver: "auto" });
 * await world.initialize();
 * ```
 *
 * ## Three differences from the renderer registry, all forced by §37
 *
 * 1. **Selection is synchronous.** `PhysicsWorld`'s constructor validates the
 *    adapter's capabilities (§21, §33) and is not async; building an adapter
 *    is likewise synchronous — a WebAssembly solver loads its module in
 *    `initialize` (plan P5-1), not in its constructor. So
 *    {@link SolverRegistry.resolve} returns an adapter, not a promise, and the
 *    world can resolve `solver` where it already resolves everything else.
 * 2. **`"auto"` filters on §37 capabilities, not on an initialization
 *    attempt.** A renderer only discovers it cannot run by trying; an adapter
 *    publishes `capabilities` before `initialize` and the answer is exact. So
 *    `"auto"` picks the first registered solver that declares the world's
 *    `dimension` and can reach its `determinism` tier — which is precisely
 *    what §37 means by capability-driven.
 * 3. **The order is registration order.** §62 fixes a preference for renderers
 *    (WebGPU → WebGL 2 → 2D); §37 fixes none for solvers, and inventing one
 *    would be this module editorialising over the specification. Registration
 *    order is the application's own stated preference, and it is stable, which
 *    is what §33 needs.
 *
 * An explicitly named solver is **not** capability-filtered here. It is handed
 * straight back, so an unsatisfiable request fails in `PhysicsWorld`'s
 * constructor with the precise §21/§33 message that already exists there
 * ("adapter X declares dimensions [2d] and cannot simulate a 3d world") rather
 * than with a vaguer one from this file. That is §62's fail-fast rule applied
 * to solvers: naming a solver means it must work.
