/**
 * `PhysicsWorld` (§20, §30, §32, §33, §34, §37, §39, §42, §43) — the object an
 * application holds and a solver adapter serves.
 *
 * §20's promise is that "users should not need to write solver-specific
 * application code for common tasks". `PhysicsWorld` is where that promise is
 * kept: it owns the registration of §6a components into a solver, the fixed-step
 * pipeline of §37/§39, the §42 transform writes, §30's named queries, §33's
 * checksum, and §34's snapshot metadata — all of it phrased over
 * `PhysicsSolverAdapter` + {@link SolverBodyAccess} and never over a solver.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const world = new PhysicsWorld({ dimension: "2d", adapter, poses: app.poses });
 * await world.initialize();
 *
 * const ball = new Group();
 * ball.transformAuthority = "physics";           // §42: the solver owns the pose
 * ball.transform.position.set(0, 5, 0);
 * ball.addComponent(new RigidBody({ type: "dynamic" }));
 * ball.addComponent(new Collider({ shape: { type: "circle", radius: 0.5 } }));
 * world.addBody(ball);
 *
 * app.systems.register(new PhysicsSystem({ worlds: [world] }));
 * ```
 *
 * ## The fixed step (§37, §39, plan P5-2)
 *
 * {@link PhysicsWorld.step} runs one fixed step in exactly this order, and
 * {@link PhysicsWorld.dispatchEvents} delivers the step's events afterwards:
 *
 * ```text
 * 1. per body, in registration order:
 *      queued §37 property changes → SolverBodyTuningAccess, then cleared
 *        (§23 mass triple, damping, gravity scale, §31 mode; and each dirty
 *         collider's §25 material and §24 filter — PH-1 stage 2)
 *      resetForces → the §26 command buffer → the §32 sleep command → clear
 *      kinematic bodies: setNextKinematicTransform / setBodyVelocities
 *        ("blended" nodes feed the PoseTarget instead of the transform, §19)
 *    per joint, in registration order: queued §28 limit/motor changes
 * 2. adapter.syncSceneToSolver()      ← §37 call-order hook (may be a no-op)
 * 3. adapter.step(fixedDeltaTime)     ← §10: seconds, never milliseconds
 * 4. adapter.syncSolverToScene()      ← §37 call-order hook (may be a no-op)
 * 5. per body, in registration order:
 *      "blended" → node.transform = blend(target pose, solver pose) (§19, §42)
 *      dynamic   → node.transform under "physics" authority (§42)
 *      every body → RigidBody velocities, RigidBody.sleeping (§23, §32)
 * 6. adapter.drainEvents() → translated to component references and queued
 * 7. per breakable joint, in registration order: reaction vs §28 thresholds →
 *      destroy + queue "jointbreak" (plan P6-2)
 * 8. dispatchEvents() → §29 events on node emitters (§39 step 9, §6b)
 * ```
 *
 * The property changes at the top of step 1 come **before** the forces because
 * a force applied in the same frame as a mass change should act on the new
 * mass. A body nobody wrote to costs one integer comparison there and no solver
 * call, which is why a quiet world's call sequence is exactly what it was
 * before that line existed (§33).
 *
 * Step 7 comes after step 6 because a break is the engine's *conclusion* from
 * the solved step, not something that happened during it: the contacts of the
 * step are queued first and the breaks that follow from them last, which is the
 * order a listener reads them in.
 *
 * Step 8 is deliberately a separate call: §39 puts event dispatch after the
 * solve, and `PhysicsSystem` steps *every* world before dispatching any world's
 * events, so a listener that touches a second world always sees a world that has
 * finished its step. A listener may create bodies, destroy bodies, or step
 * nothing at all — the queue was handed over before the first callback ran.
 *
 * ## Poses and §43 interpolation
 *
 * A world given a `PoseBuffer` tracks the node of every **dynamic** body it
 * registers and untracks it on removal. It does not capture: §39 puts the pose
 * snapshot at step 10 (`PRIORITY_SNAPSHOT`, after the solve at step 6), so the
 * engine's one capture — `createSnapshotSystem`, registered by `Application`
 * whenever pose interpolation is on — already records the post-step pose as
 * "current" and the previous step's post-step pose (which *is* the pre-step
 * pose, since nothing else moves a body between steps) as "previous". A second
 * capture from inside the physics step would shift the pair twice per step and
 * flatten interpolation to a constant, which is the artefact §43 exists to
 * remove. See `@four/scene`'s `interpolation.ts`, which states the same
 * arrangement from the buffer's side.
 *
 * An application that drives a world without the snapshot system gets no
 * interpolation and should register `createSnapshotSystem(poses)`.
 *
 * A `"blended"` node is tracked whatever its §22 body type, because the §19
 * pipeline writes its transform every step; a `"physics"` node is tracked
 * exactly while it is dynamic, as before. Tracking follows the node's live
 * authority — it is re-evaluated in the publish pass, so flipping
 * `transformAuthority` after registration is honoured from the next step.
 *
 * ## §19 blending, and the one system this package cannot register itself
 *
 * Under `"blended"` authority (§42) the world runs §19's pipeline for a node:
 * before the solve it feeds the node's `PoseTarget` to a kinematic body, and
 * after the solve it writes the weighted combination of that target and the
 * solver's pose (see {@link PhysicsWorld.step}). It needs the trio — `"blended"`
 * authority, a `RigidBody` registered here, and a `PoseTarget` on the node — and
 * says so with a `FourError` naming the missing piece.
 *
 * §19's finite-difference history (`PoseTarget.previousPosition`, which
 * `setBodyControlMode`'s velocity inheritance reads) needs
 * `PoseTarget.capturePrevious` called **once per fixed step, before that step's
 * animation writes**, which is *earlier* than the solve and therefore cannot
 * happen inside {@link PhysicsWorld.step}. That call site is
 * {@link PhysicsWorld.capturePoseTargets}, wrapped by
 * {@link createPoseTargetCaptureSystem} — a second `SimulationSystem` the
 * application must register alongside `PhysicsSystem`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const physics = new PhysicsSystem({ worlds: [world] });
 * app.systems.register(createPoseTargetCaptureSystem(physics.worlds));
 * app.systems.register(physics);
 * ```
 *
 * Forgetting it does not break the blend — the blend reads the target's
 * *current* pose — but it leaves every target's history STALE at whatever
 * `copyFrom` seeded, so `setBodyControlMode(..., { inheritVelocityFrom })`
 * divides the target's TOTAL animated displacement by one fixed delta and
 * inherits a wildly inflated velocity (measured: 60 m/s from a 2 m/s
 * animation after half a second — WP-7.5). Zero is inherited only for a
 * never-animated target. Register the capture system whenever inheritance
 * is used.
 *
 * ## What the world does not own
 *
 * The scheduler (§10: the accumulator and the sub-step clamp are the
 * application clock's), the node transforms of anything but registered dynamic
 * bodies, and the adapter's lifetime before construction. `dispose()` does
 * dispose the adapter — a world is the only thing that steps it, and §83 wants
 * one owner.

  /**
   * Registers `node`'s body and its colliders with the solver (§23, §24, §37).

   * node.addComponent(new RigidBody({ type: "dynamic" }));
   * node.addComponent(new Collider({ shape: { type: "circle", radius: 0.5 } }));
   * world.addBody(node);
   * ```
   *
   * ## Which colliders are registered (decision, WP-5.3)
   *
   * The **whole subtree** rooted at `node` is scanned, depth-first in child
   * insertion order and to unbounded depth, and a collider joins this body when
   * its own §24 ancestor walk (`Collider.body`: the nearest `RigidBody` at or
   * above its node) names **this** body.
   *
   * So the scan is the exact dual of the resolution a collider already performs,
   * and it needs no second rule: an intermediate node with no body is
   * transparent — a visual grouping node between a body and its collider changes
   * nothing — while a descendant that carries its own `RigidBody` claims its own
   * colliders, which are skipped here and registered by their own
   * `addBody(childNode)` call. That is why several colliders on one body are
   * expressed as child nodes (WP-5.2).
   *
   * The scan happens **once**, here. A `Collider` attached after this call is
   * handed over with {@link PhysicsWorld.addCollider}, which applies the same
   * §24 resolution to one component (PH-5); one attached and never handed over
   * simply is not simulated.
   *
   * ## The initial pose (decision, WP-5.3)
   *
   * An authored `position`/`rotation` on the `RigidBody` descriptor wins; when
   * the descriptor carried neither, the body starts at the node's **local**
   * `transform` — which is where the author put it, and refusing to read it
   * would drop a body at the origin the first time it is registered. Either way
   * the solved pose is written back onto the node after the first step (§42), so
   * the node and the solver converge immediately.
   *
   * Phase 5 reads and writes the *local* transform, so a body node is expected
   * to sit at the scene root or under an identity ancestor chain; a hierarchy
   * that scales or rotates above a body is out of scope until the §19 pipeline
   * of Phase 7.
   *
   * ## Mass (§23, §25; plan §6d note of 2026-08-01)
   *
   * Mass-from-density is the solver's derivation, so after the colliders exist
   * the world reads `getBodyMass` back onto the component: a dynamic body whose
   * mass was never authored stops reporting `inverseMass === NaN`. A solver that
   * reports a non-positive mass — a body with no collider, or a static body —
   * leaves the component alone, because §23 forbids expressing "does not
   * simulate" as a zero mass.
   *
   * The value lands on `RigidBody.derivedMass` and **does not author**
   * `RigidBody.mass` (2026-08-06): `mass` still reports it, `toDescriptor()`
   * still omits it, and a body registered twice derives twice instead of
   * freezing the first solver's answer. See `#refreshMassProperties`.
   *
   * Assigning `body.type` after registration changes the **component** and not
   * the solver — the two would then disagree about what is being simulated. Use
   * {@link PhysicsWorld.setBodyControlMode} to change a registered body's §22
   * model: it re-types the solver body in place and moves the component with it
   * (plan P7-3), and it is what §19's control-mode transitions go through.
   *
   * @returns the registered `RigidBody` component
   * ## The frame the body is registered in (§8, PH-12)
   *
   * `"world"` — the frame every body is solved in unless its `RigidBody`
   * declares otherwise through `RigidBody.space`. Any other §8 mode is
   * **refused**, with a message that distinguishes §8's own prohibition on
   * simulating screen-space content from `"local-plane"`'s unbuilt §21 mapping.
   * See `#requireSimulationSpace`.
   *
   * @throws FourError if the world is not initialized, if `node` has no
   * `RigidBody`, if it is already registered, if the body declares a §8 space
   * mode this world cannot simulate, if a scanned collider has no body (§23),

   *
   * The new registration is appended to its body's collider list, which keeps
   * that list in **ascending adapter collider id** — the order the per-step
   * drain and every checksum-visible iteration depend on — because adapter
   * collider ids are monotonic and never reused, so a collider created now
   * outranks every collider created before it.
   *
   * The body's mass is then re-read from the solver, since §23/§25 derive a
   * mass from collider density: a derived-mass body gains this collider's
   * contribution, and an authored-mass body keeps the mass it authored (the
   * adapter is what decides which collider carries it — see
   * `PhysicsSolverAdapter.createCollider`). Nothing is created in the solver
   * until every check has passed, so a rejected call leaves the world exactly
   * as it found it (§85).
   *
   * @returns the registered collider, for chaining
   * @throws FourError if the world is not initialized, if the collider is
   * already registered here, if it has no `RigidBody` above it (§23), if that
   * body is not registered with this world, or if the collider is invalid for
   * this dimension (§21, §85)

   *
   * A handle taken from here is **opaque and unforgeable** (`types.ts`), and

   * package's:
   *
   * - it is valid only while the body is registered with **this** world — a
   *   `removeBody`, a re-registration, or `dispose()` invalidates it, and using
   *   a stale handle is the adapter's error to raise;
   * - what a write does is the *solver's* business: `PhysicsWorld` does not see
   *   it, does not mirror it onto the component, and cannot keep §33's
   *   checksums comparable across runs that did it differently;
   * - a write that changes the simulation makes the component's mirrors
   *   (`mass`, damping, `gravityScale`) stale in the other direction. The
   *   component is not re-read from the solver except for velocities and the
   *   sleep flag.
   *
   * Prefer the supported routes where they exist: §26's force and impulse
   * commands, {@link PhysicsWorld.setBodyControlMode} for §22 types, and
   * `removeBody` + `addBody` to rebuild a body from a changed descriptor.

   * assignment is unobservable. The alternatives were to shadow-copy six values
   * per collider and diff them every step, which is real per-step cost for
   * something that changes almost never, or to say so. This says so.
   *
   * Marking is idempotent, costs no allocation, and is served in ascending

   * world.setBodyControlMode(door, "dynamic", { inheritVelocityFrom: target });
   * ```
   *
   * ## In place, and why that matters (§33)
   *
   * The body is **not** destroyed and re-created. It keeps its solver handle,
   * its monotonic id, its position in the checksum's iteration order, its
   * colliders, its mass properties, and its pose — all that changes is which of
   * §22's models the solver runs it under, plus (optionally) its velocities.
   * Two otherwise identical runs whose only difference is a mid-run switch
   * therefore produce the same body set in the same order, which is what lets a
   * control-mode change appear inside a §33 replay at all. Removing and
   * re-adding the body would mint a fresh id and re-key every registry against
   * it.
   *
   * ## What it updates
   *
   * 1. the solver, through `SolverBodyAccess.setBodyType`;
   * 2. the `RigidBody` component's `type`, so `body.type` and `inverseMass`
   *    report what is actually being simulated;
   * 3. the registration's own record of the type, which is what the fixed-step
   *    pipeline branches on — so the §22 kinematic feed and the §42 transform
   *    write follow the **new** type from the very next step: a body switched to
   *    `"kinematic-position"` starts being fed the node's transform as a target,
   *    and one switched to `"dynamic"` starts publishing the solved pose;
   * 4. §43 pose tracking, which follows dynamic-ness exactly as
   *    {@link PhysicsWorld.addBody} sets it.
   *
   * ## §23's mass rule for the new type
   *
   * A `"dynamic"` body needs a mass, so a switch **to** `"dynamic"` is refused
   * unless one is authored (`RigidBody.mass`) or derivable — that is, unless the
   * solver already reports a positive mass for the body, which it does whenever
   * the body carries a collider with a density (§23, §25). Activating a
   * ragdoll limb that has no collider would otherwise produce a massless
   * dynamic body: Rapier leaves such a body motionless (measured at 0.19.3),
   * which is a silently wrong simulation rather than an error. An authored
   * `mass` is re-validated against the new type as well, by the same
   * `validateMass` the component's setter uses.
   *
   * Nothing is written to the solver until every check has passed (§85).
   *
   * ## Velocity inheritance (§19's ragdoll activation)
   *
   * With `inheritVelocityFrom`, the body's velocities are seeded from one fixed
   * step of the target's own motion, so an activated body continues the
   * animation's trajectory instead of dropping from rest:
   *
   * ```text
   * dt      = the fixed step (see BodyControlModeOptions.fixedDeltaSeconds)
   * linear  = (position − previousPosition) / dt                     [m/s]
   *
   * qDelta  = rotation · previousRotation⁻¹        (world-frame delta, unit)
   * qDelta  ← −qDelta   when qDelta.w < 0          (shortest arc, plan D8)
   * s       = |(qDelta.x, qDelta.y, qDelta.z)|     = |sin(θ/2)|
   * θ       = 2 · atan2(s, qDelta.w)                                 [rad]
   * angular = (qDelta.xyz / s) · (θ / dt)                            [rad/s]
   *           = 0 when s = 0 (no rotation to differentiate)
   * ```
   *
   * `atan2` and not `2·asin(s)`: the arcsine form loses the difference between
   * a rotation and its supplement past a quarter turn per step, and `atan2`
   * stays accurate for the small deltas one fixed step actually produces. The
   * sign flip is the same shortest-arc rule `Quaternion.slerp` documents — `q`
   * and `−q` are the same rotation, and only one of them is the short way
   * round, so without it a target that crossed the quaternion sign boundary
   * would inherit a spin of nearly `2π/dt` in the wrong direction.
   *
   * Left-multiplying by the inverse of the *previous* rotation puts the delta in
   * the **world** frame, which is the frame §23's `angularVelocity` is stated in
   * (`qDelta · previous = current`). In a `"2d"` world a pure-Z target produces
   * an exactly pure-Z result — the Hamilton product's x and y terms cancel to
   * zero — so §21's planar check passes without a fudge; a target carrying
   * off-plane rotation is rejected by that check, as it should be.
   *
   * Inheritance is accepted only for `"dynamic"` and `"kinematic-velocity"`,
   * the two types that *have* a velocity: a `"static"` or
   * `"kinematic-position"` body ignores velocity entirely, so seeding one would
   * be a command that silently does nothing.
   *
   * The seeded velocities are written through `setBodyVelocities`, so they are
   * solver state immediately and are published back onto the component by the
   * next step (§23). Allocates nothing.

   * Shifts every registered body's `PoseTarget` history one fixed step forward

   * P7-4).
   *
   * ## Why this is not part of `step`
   *
   * The history is what `(position − previousPosition) / dt` differences into
   * the velocity an activated ragdoll inherits (§19,
   * {@link PhysicsWorld.setBodyControlMode}), so "previous" has to mean *the
   * target one fixed step ago*. Capturing inside the step would run at §39 step
   * 6, **after** step 3 has written this step's target: `previous` would become
   * this step's pose and every difference would be zero. The capture therefore
   * belongs before animation, which is a different slot in the §39 order and so
   * a different system — {@link createPoseTargetCaptureSystem}, which is the
   * call site and which an application must register (see the module header).
   *
   * ## Every registered body, not only the blended ones
   *
   * A target's history is read by velocity inheritance as well as by the blend,
   * and inheritance is precisely what a body that is *not yet* blended or
   * dynamic uses at the moment it is switched (§19's ragdoll activation). A body
   * whose node carries no `PoseTarget` is skipped; nothing here validates the
   * §19 trio, because a target with no blend is a perfectly ordinary thing to
   * animate and the blend's own error is raised by the step that blends.
   *
   * Capturing bumps no version and touches no solver, so this is safe to call on
   * a world that has not been initialized (a `PhysicsSystem` may well be
   * registered before `initialize` resolves). Calling it twice in one fixed step
   * collapses every difference to zero — see `PoseTarget.capturePrevious`.
   * Allocates nothing.

   *
   * This is the iteration a §39 step-5 force generator walks —
   * {@link ForceFieldSystem} is the one this package ships (§26, §27) — and it

   *
   * - **dynamic** (§22): a force on a static or kinematic body does nothing by
   *   definition, so visiting one would be work whose result is discarded;
   * - **awake** (§32): a non-zero force wakes a body — which is why `step`
   *   skips zero-magnitude accumulations — so a generator that visited sleeping
   *   bodies would wake every body every step and §32 would stop meaning
   *   anything. Waking a settled body is `RigidBody.wake()`, an explicit
   *   command, and deliberately not a side effect of ambient wind.
   *
   * The centre of mass, not the transform origin, because it is where §26's
   * `applyForce` acts: for an off-centre or compound body (§24) the origin can
   * be anywhere, including outside the shape, and a generator that sampled
   * there would describe a different place from the one it pushes. It is read
   * from the solver (`SolverBodyAccess.getBodyCenterOfMass`) after mass-property
   * resolution, into **one shared vector that is overwritten on every visit** —
   * copy it if you need it after the callback returns (§7b).

   *
   * ## Ordering, in full
   *
   * 1. Events are dispatched **in the adapter's `drainEvents` order**, which
   *    §37 requires to be deterministic for a given step. The world neither
   *    sorts nor derives events — an adapter that reports `collisionstay`
   *    reports it itself.
   * 2. A collision event is emitted on **`bodyA`'s emitter first, then
   *    `bodyB`'s**, with the same payload object both times: §29 fixes no
   *    meaning to the A/B order beyond internal consistency, so re-labelling the
   *    pair per listener would be inventing information. A pair whose colliders
   *    share one body is emitted once.
   * 3. A trigger event is emitted on the **sensor collider's** emitter only —
   *    §29's `sensor.on("triggerenter", …)`. Two overlapping sensors are
   *    reported by the adapter as two events, once from each side, so each
   *    sensor's listeners still fire.
   * 4. A sleep or wake event is emitted on the **body**. `RigidBody.sleeping`
   *    was already refreshed during the step, so a listener sees the state the
   *    event announces.
   * 5. A `"jointbreak"` is emitted on the **joint** (§28, plan P6-2), which is
   *    already destroyed and unregistered by then — a listener sees the joint in
   *    its final state, and `joint.broken` is `true`. It is emitted on the joint
   *    alone and not on the two bodies: §29's body event map is the collision
   *    and sleep vocabulary, and a joint has its own emitter to subscribe to.
   *
   * The queue is handed over before the first callback runs, so a listener may
   * create bodies, remove bodies, or step another world without re-entering
   * this dispatch or losing events; anything a re-entrant step queues is
   * dispatched by that step's own `dispatchEvents`.

   *
   * > Physics normally operates in world or local-plane space. Screen-space UI
   * > should not automatically participate in physical simulation unless
   * > explicitly mapped to a simulation plane.
   *
   * A body declares its frame with `RigidBody.space`, whose default is
   * `"world"`, so **every scene written before this check passes it
   * unchanged** — the check can only fire on a body that went out of its way to
   * say it is solved somewhere else.
   *
   * ## Two refusals, for two different reasons
   *
   * - `"screen"`, `"viewport"`, `"camera"`, `"billboard"` are refused because
   *   §8 says so. The sentence's escape hatch — "unless explicitly mapped to a
   *   simulation plane" — is a mapping the author performs: build the body on a
   *   node in the simulated frame and drive the presentation node from it. A
   *   body silently simulated in pixels is precisely what §8 forbids.
   * - `"local-plane"` is legal under §8 and is refused **here** because §21's
   *   plane frame ("nodes simulating in local-plane space use the plane's own
   *   2D frame, which the engine maps to the world XY frame of the `"2d"`
   *   world") is not implemented. Accepting it would simulate the body in world
   *   space while its author asked for a plane — accepted-and-ignored, which
   *   this repository refuses on principle. The named seam is a plane
   *   descriptor on the world plus a mapping in the publish pass; until it
   *   exists, `"world"` is the only frame a body may be registered in.
   *
   * The two are told apart in the message, because the fixes are different: one
   * is an authoring mistake, the other is an unbuilt feature. `@four/core`'s
   * `isSimulationSpaceMode` is what separates them, and it answers §8's
   * question rather than this world's — so a packet that implements §21's
   * mapping edits this method and leaves the predicate alone.

   *
   * ## Why these thresholds and not the guide's own advice
   *
   * The guide *advises* keeping masses within ~100× and sizes within ~0.1–10
   * units. A warning fired at the advice would go off in scenes that are
   * perfectly stable, and the fastest way to make a diagnostic useless is to
   * make it routine. Each threshold here is therefore an order of magnitude
   * past the advice: crossing one does not mean "you ignored the guide", it
   * means "you are far enough past it that the solver is likely to show it".
   *
   * **Static and kinematic colliders are exempt from the scale check.** A
   * 40-unit ground slab or a level's triangle mesh is not a scale mistake; the
   * §41 concern is contact tolerance between things that *move*.
   *
   * **It adds no solver call.** `solverMass` is the number

   * Deferred from `addBody` to here on purpose. PH-5 allows `addCollider` after

   * filter nobody asked for, and this packet ships no hidden smoothing. It also

   * ## One `destroyBody`, not one call per collider (2026-08-07)
   *
   * §37 defines `destroyBody` as destroying "a body and everything attached to
   * it", so the body's colliders are the adapter's to free and this method
   * frees them by destroying the body. It used to call `destroyCollider` for
   * each of them first, which was work no one could observe and work that cost:
   * every such call re-established the §23 mass of a body that ceased to exist
   * on the next line — on the Rapier adapters a `Collider.setMass` on a
   * collider already being removed plus a `recomputeMassPropertiesFromColliders`
   * per collider, each preceded by a scan for the body's surviving
   * lowest-id collider. Teardown of an N-collider body was quadratic in the
   * world's collider count for a result that was immediately discarded.
   *
   * **Teardown path only, and nothing else moved.** A world registers and
   * unregisters colliders with their body — there is no single-collider
   * removal on this class — so this is the only call site that changed;
   * `PhysicsSolverAdapter.destroyCollider` remains §37's contract for an
   * adapter used directly, and both Rapier adapters keep the mass refresh that
   * matters when a collider is destroyed and its body survives. Step order,
   * event dispatch, and the order of the registry deletions below are
   * untouched: the component→handle indices are still released in reverse
   * registration order, and a stepping world sees exactly the solver calls it
   * saw before.
   *
   * The one thing this leans on is the §37 sentence quoted above. An adapter
   * whose `destroyBody` left its colliders behind was already violating it —
   * and would previously have been rescued by this method's per-collider calls,
   * which is a rescue no contract promised.
