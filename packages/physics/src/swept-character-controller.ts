/**
 * §12's **solver-backed** character controller — {@link SweptCharacterController}
 * and the {@link SweptCharacterSystem} that advances it (`PH-11b`, 2026-08-21).
 *
 * `PH-11` shipped the kinematic half in `@four/motion`: a `CharacterController`
 * whose ground is a horizontal *plane*, which needs no collision query at all.
 * Its module note named what it staged and where the staged half had to live:
 *
 * > What is **staged, with its seam named**: capsule sweeps, slide-along-wall,
 * > step height, slope limits and moving platforms. Every one of them needs a
 * > shape cast against the collision world. `@four/physics` already has one —
 * > `PhysicsWorld.shapeCast` (§30) — but §3.1's frozen dependency matrix gives
 * > `@four/motion` only `core`, `math` and `scene`, and the edge runs the other
 * > way: **`physics` depends on `motion`.**
 *
 * This module is that packet. §30 promises the cast in as many words —
 * `world.shapeCast(shape, transform, direction, options)`, with "collision
 * groups; masks; ignored bodies; first hit; ... custom filters" — and
 * {@link SweptCharacterController} is that promise spent on the four features
 * §12 leaves a plane unable to express: a **capsule sweep**, **slide along
 * wall**, **step height** and a **slope limit**.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const player = new Group();
 * player.transformAuthority = "kinematic";               // §42 — required
 * const character = player.addComponent(
 *   new SweptCharacterController({
 *     world,                                             // the collision world
 *     radius: 0.35,
 *     halfHeight: 0.5,                                   // capsule, +Y axis (§24)
 *     moveSpeed: 4,
 *     stepHeight: 0.35,
 *     slopeLimit: Math.PI / 4,                           // radians (§7a)
 *   }),
 * );
 *
 * const characters = new SweptCharacterSystem();
 * characters.track(player);
 * app.systems.register(characters);                      // priority 400, §39 step 4
 * app.systems.register(new PhysicsSystem({ worlds: [world] }));   // 600
 * ```
 *
 * ## The recorded question: *extends* or *holds*? — **holds** (decision)
 *
 * `TODO.md` filed this packet with one open question: "whether the swept
 * controller *extends* the kinematic one or holds one". It **holds** one, and
 * the reason is a fact about the source rather than a taste:
 *
 * - `CharacterController`'s vertical state — `#verticalVelocity`, `#grounded`,
 *   `#headingDirty` — is **ES-private with no setters**. `jump()` and
 *   `ground()` are the only mutators, and neither can express "stopped by a
 *   ceiling", "walked off a ledge", or "landed on a 20° ramp at y = 1.37". A
 *   subclass overriding `step` therefore *cannot maintain the state its own
 *   inherited getters report*.
 * - And it should not want to. `CharacterController.grounded` is a promise
 *   about a **plane**: "the character is standing at `groundHeight`". A swept
 *   controller's `grounded` is a promise about **geometry**: "the last downward
 *   cast found a collider whose normal is within `slopeLimit`". Those are
 *   different propositions that happen to share a name.
 *
 * So `extends` would inherit a public API it cannot keep true — `grounded`,
 * `verticalVelocity`, `jump()`, `ground()`, `groundHeight` — which is precisely
 * the *accepted-and-ignored* failure this repository refuses elsewhere. The
 * rule worth keeping: **inherit only when you can keep every inherited
 * promise.**
 *
 * Holding gets what the gap analysis actually asked for ("reusing
 * `CharacterController`'s intent/heading/gravity state") without any of that.
 * The held instance is the **parameter, heading and intent store**, and every
 * member of it this class needs is public:
 *
 * | held for | reached through |
 * |---|---|
 * | heading | `yaw` (get/set), `turn(delta)` |
 * | planar intent, clamped to the unit disc | `setMoveIntent`, `stop`, `intentForward`, `intentRight` |
 * | locomotion and fall parameters, with their §85 refusals | `moveSpeed`, `gravity`, `jumpSpeed`, `maxFallSpeed` |
 *
 * Nothing is duplicated: the unit-disc clamp (and its recorded `Math.sqrt`
 * -not-`Math.hypot` §33 decision), the unbounded-yaw convention and every
 * `RangeError` in §85's authoring tier are **executed by the held object**, so
 * a swept character and a kinematic one cannot drift apart on what an intent,
 * a heading or a negative `moveSpeed` means. What this class adds is the
 * vertical integrator and the collision resolution — the half whose meaning
 * changed. The held controller's own `step` is never called and its
 * `groundHeight` is never read; neither is exposed.
 *
 * ## Collide and slide (§30), and why the iteration count is a constant
 *
 * One fixed step resolves in three phases, all of them shape casts of the same
 * capsule through {@link PhysicsWorld.shapeCast}:
 *
 * ```text
 * 1. horizontal   intent → velocity → Δ, then collide-and-slide, ≤ maxSlides casts
 *                 (+ up to 3 more for one step-up attempt)
 * 2. vertical     grounded → one downward probe (snap or leave the ground)
 *                 airborne → integrate gravity, one cast along the Δ
 * 3. write        one finiteness check, then position and rotation together
 * ```
 *
 * The horizontal phase is the classic collide-and-slide: cast the capsule along
 * what is left of the motion, advance to just short of the impact
 * ({@link SweptCharacterController.skinWidth} short), remove the component of
 * the remainder that points into the surface, and go again. Each iteration
 * either consumes distance or removes a degree of freedom, so a character in a
 * corner converges — but "converges" is not "terminates", and a cast that
 * reports a zero distance every time (a capsule that starts already overlapping,
 * which §30 says is reported as `distance: 0`) would spin forever. The loop is
 * therefore bounded by {@link SweptCharacterController.maxSlides}, a **stated
 * constant** rather than an epsilon: the worst case is a fixed number of solver
 * calls per character per step, which is what a fixed step (§10) needs from
 * everything inside it. Motion left over when the budget runs out is **dropped**
 * — the character stops — because the alternative is to move it into geometry.
 *
 * The step-up attempt is tried at most **once** per fixed step and only from a
 * grounded character blocked by a surface too steep to walk: cast up by
 * `stepHeight`, cast forward from up there **by at least one capsule radius**,
 * cast back down, and accept the result only if it lands on ground within
 * `slopeLimit` and no lower than it started. Three casts, bounded, and it
 * refuses rather than teleports. The radius floor on the forward reach is the
 * non-obvious part and it is load-bearing: a step that stopped with half the
 * capsule over the lip would contact the step's *edge*, and an edge's contact
 * normal is not the tread's — the flat surface underneath would read as too
 * steep to stand on and the character would jitter on the lip for ever. So a
 * step-up may deliberately over-step by up to one radius, at most once per
 * fixed step.
 *
 * ## §42: `"kinematic"`, even though it consults the solver (decision)
 *
 * §42 asks who **writes** a node's transform, and every query here is a *read*.
 * The pose is derived from the character's intent, its heading and the geometry
 * it swept through, and then written by this system; the solver never writes
 * this node and is never asked to. `"physics"` would be a false claim — it
 * would also make `PhysicsWorld`'s publish pass overwrite the character with a
 * solver pose that does not exist. §12's opening sentence has already settled
 * the tier for us: *"Kinematic controllers directly prescribe movement."* A
 * swept controller still prescribes; it merely consults geometry first about
 * what the prescription is allowed to be.
 *
 * ## §39: step 4, with the kinematics — *before* the solve (decision)
 *
 * {@link SweptCharacterSystem} defaults to `PRIORITY_KINEMATICS` (400), the
 * same §39 step 4 `KinematicSystem` occupies, and **not** a slot after the
 * solve. Three reasons, in order of force:
 *
 * 1. **A kinematic body is fed from the node transform at the top of
 *    `world.step`.** `PhysicsWorld`'s documented step order reads "1. per body
 *    … kinematic bodies: `setNextKinematicTransform`". So a character carrying
 *    a `"kinematic-position"` `RigidBody` — which is how dynamic objects come
 *    to collide with it at all — has *this step's* pose pushed into the solver
 *    if and only if it was written before step 6. Writing after the solve would
 *    delay the character's own collider by one full step behind the pose it
 *    just computed, and the sweep would then be resolving against a world in
 *    which the character is somewhere else.
 * 2. **The geometry it queries is start-of-step geometry, which is the only
 *    self-consistent reading.** At priority 400 every cast sees the world as
 *    the previous step's solve left it — exactly the convention
 *    `ForceFieldSystem` states for velocity ("the start-of-step value"), and it
 *    pairs correctly with (1): the character's collider and the geometry it
 *    swept against are then from the same instant.
 * 3. **It is a prescription, and step 4 is where prescriptions are written.**
 *    Reading the solved world instead would make the character a *reaction* to
 *    the solve, which is what §22's dynamic bodies are for.
 *
 * ## One authority, and the second system this could not avoid
 *
 * The `PH-11` rule stands: "one authority means one system, even when the
 * components are unrelated". This packet is the exception the rule's own
 * argument permits, and the reason is §3.1 rather than preference —
 * `KinematicSystem` lives in `@four/motion`, which may not name
 * `PhysicsWorld`, so it *cannot* advance a solver-backed controller no matter
 * how much one would prefer it to. `@four/physics` publishing a
 * `SimulationSystem` at a `@four/motion` priority is the established shape here
 * (`ForceFieldSystem` at 500, `createPoseTargetCaptureSystem` before 300).
 *
 * What the rule was protecting against — *a second writer of one node that
 * nothing could catch* — is caught: the two systems dispatch on **disjoint
 * component types**, so a node reached by both is a node carrying both a
 * `CharacterController` and a `SweptCharacterController`, and
 * {@link SweptCharacterSystem.fixedUpdate} refuses to advance such a node and
 * says so once. Two locomotion components on one node is an authoring mistake,
 * not a layering.
 *
 * ## The frame: world space, by the same identification the publish pass makes
 *
 * A cast is world-space; `transform.position` is parent-local. This class
 * writes the second with the first, which is the identification
 * `PhysicsWorld`'s publish pass already makes when it reads a solver's world
 * pose straight into `node.transform.position`. So the rule is the tier's
 * existing one, restated: **a node driven by the physics tier lives in an
 * untransformed parent chain.** A character parented under a rotated or moved
 * ancestor is outside this contract — and is also the moving-platform case,
 * which is staged below.
 *
 * ## What is staged, and the seam for each
 *
 * - **Pushing dynamic bodies.** A sweep that hits a `"dynamic"` collider stops
 *   or slides the character against it and applies **nothing**. Pushing is a
 *   *force* question (§26), and the honest version needs a policy this packet
 *   has no basis to choose: how much impulse, split how against the body's mass
 *   (§23), and whether it may wake a sleeping body (§32) — the same
 *   "alarm clock" question `ForceFieldSystem` declined. **Seam:** a
 *   `pushImpulse` option plus `RigidBody.applyImpulseAtPoint` at
 *   `ShapeCastHit.point`, which is already world-space and already carried by
 *   every hit.
 * - **Moving-platform carry.** A character *stands on* a dynamic or kinematic
 *   body perfectly well — grounding is a geometric fact and the probe reports
 *   it — but it is **not carried** when that body moves. Carry needs the
 *   platform's per-step delta, which means its previous pose (§43's
 *   `PoseBuffer`, captured at step 10 *after* this system runs) and a §42 story
 *   for a node whose motion is partly another node's. **Seam, made concrete:**
 *   {@link SweptCharacterController.groundBody} is published, so an application
 *   can difference the platform's transform itself and call
 *   {@link SweptCharacterController.translate} before the step that should
 *   carry it.
 * - **Coyote time and jump buffering.** Deliberately absent. Neither is a
 *   collision fact; both are input-feel policies expressed in *frames the
 *   player is forgiven*, and an application composes them from `grounded` in
 *   three lines. Absent beats accepted-and-ignored — `CharacterController`'s
 *   `maxAngularSpeed` argument, applied to a timer.
 * - **`"2d"` worlds.** Refused at construction (§85). A heading about `+Y` is
 *   the whole of this class's planar model and a 2D character has no heading —
 *   it has a facing and a single movement axis. That is a different class with
 *   a different intent surface, not a flag on this one.
 *
 * ## Determinism (§33)
 *
 * **`same-runtime`** — and note *why* it cannot be better here even though the
 * arithmetic below is ordinary: this controller consumes solver queries, so it
 * inherits the solver's tier. Rapier is compiled WebAssembly whose state
 * crosses the JS/wasm boundary as f64 → f32, so a shape cast's distance and
 * normal are runtime-bound before this file touches them. On top of that the
 * class calls `Math.sin`/`Math.cos` (the heading basis and the yaw quaternion),
 * `Math.sqrt` (never `Math.hypot` — only `sqrt` is specified exactly rounded)
 * and `Math.cos` once at construction for the slope limit. No clock, no
 * `Math.random`, no hash-ordered iteration, and no allocation after
 * construction beyond the hit arrays `PhysicsWorld.shapeCast` itself returns.
 * `tests/determinism/swept-character.test.ts` is the golden, on real Rapier 3D.
