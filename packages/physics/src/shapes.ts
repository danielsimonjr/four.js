/**
 * Collision shapes (§24) and their §85 parameter validation.
 *
 * ## What ships (PH-22a, 2026-08-08)
 *
 * §24 requires seven 2D shapes (circle, rectangle, capsule, polygon, polyline,
 * chain, compound) and nine 3D shapes (sphere, box, capsule, cylinder, cone,
 * convex hull, triangle mesh, height field, compound). Phase 5 shipped the
 * primitive tier; PH-22a adds every remaining §24 shape a solver in this
 * repository can build *and* solve:
 *
 * | Dimension | Shipped                                                                                 |
 * | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | `"2d"`    | circle, rectangle, capsule, polygon, polyline, chain                                      |
 * | `"3d"`    | sphere, box, capsule, cylinder, cone, convex-hull, triangle-mesh, height-field            |
 *
 * **`compound` is shipped as composition, not as a tag.** §24 lists it in both
 * dimensions, and it is the one §24 entry that is not a shape: it is *several*
 * shapes on one body. That is exactly what a body with several
 * {@link "./collider".Collider} components already is — and, since PH-5, what
 * `PhysicsWorld.addCollider` / `removeCollider` can assemble and take apart at
 * runtime. Rapier itself has no compound collider for the same reason. A
 * `{ type: "compound", parts: [...] }` tag would be a second way to say the
 * same thing, with its own offsets, its own material rules, and no second
 * simulation behind it, so it is deliberately absent (decision, 2026-08-08).
 *
 * ### Which shapes a §30 query may use
 *
 * Four of the shipped shapes are **composite** — `polyline`, `chain`,
 * `triangle-mesh`, `height-field`. They are legal collider shapes and illegal
 * *query* shapes: {@link validateQueryShape} refuses them for §30's `overlap`
 * and `shapeCast`. This is not conservatism. Measured against Rapier 0.19.3
 * (2026-08-08): a flat `Heightfield` placed at the centre of a 2×2×2 cuboid —
 * an unambiguous overlap — is reported by `World.intersectionsWithShape` as
 * **zero** intersections. A composite query shape does not fail, it answers
 * wrongly, which is the one outcome this repository does not ship. Every
 * convex shape stays available to both queries.
 *
 * ## Conventions (§7a, §7b)
 *
 * - The world is right-handed and **Y-up in both dimensions**; a `"2d"` shape
 *   lives in the world XY plane.
 * - Capsule and every other extent is expressed in **half** measures
 *   (`halfExtents`, `halfHeight`), matching the solvers this API sits above and
 *   removing the halving that a full-extent API repeats at every call site.
 * - A capsule's axis is **+Y**, so the same declaration means the same upright
 *   capsule in a 2D and a 3D world. A cylinder's and a cone's axis is **+Y**
 *   too, and a cone's **apex is at `+halfHeight`** — measured against Rapier
 *   0.19.3 by raycasting a `radius = 0.5`, `halfHeight = 1` cone along −X at
 *   three heights and reading the surface off at `x = 0.025 / 0.25 / 0.475`
 *   for `y = +0.9 / 0 / −0.9`, i.e. `r(y) = radius · (halfHeight − y) / (2 ·
 *   halfHeight)`.
 * - Shapes carry `Vector2`/`Vector3` instances, which are mutable (§7b). The
 *   descriptor holds a reference, not a copy: mutating a vector after the
 *   collider is created does not retroactively change the collider, and
 *   re-validating a shape you have mutated is the caller's job.
 *
 * Shapes are plain data. They have no identity, no lifecycle, and no solver
 * state — {@link CollisionShape} values may be shared between any number of
 * colliders.

 * caller counts the numbers they have. `heights.length` is therefore
 * `rows * columns`, and the adapter hands the solver `rows - 1` / `columns - 1`
 * (Rapier's `heightfield(nrows, ncols, …)` takes subdivisions and wants
 * `(nrows + 1) * (ncols + 1)` heights — verified 2026-08-08 by reading
 * `nrows`/`ncols`/`heights.length` back off a built collider).
 *
 * `heights` is **column-major**: the sample at grid position
 * `(row, column)` is `heights[row + column * rows]`. Which world axis each
 * index walks was measured, again against Rapier 0.19.3, by building a 2×2
 * field with heights `[0, 1, 2, 3]` and `scale = (2, 1, 2)` and raycasting
 * down at its four corners:
 *
 * | Corner            | Height read | Grid position   |
 * | ----------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
 * | `x = −1, z = −1`  | `0`         | `(0, 0)`        |
 * | `x = −1, z = +1`  | `1`         | `(1, 0)`        |
 * | `x = +1, z = −1`  | `2`         | `(0, 1)`        |
 * | `x = +1, z = +1`  | `3`         | `(1, 1)`        |
 *
 * So **`row` walks local Z and `column` walks local X**, which is the opposite
 * of the guess a "rows are horizontal" reading produces. The field is centred
 * on the collider origin and spans `scale.x` in X and `scale.z` in Z, with
 * every height multiplied by `scale.y`.
