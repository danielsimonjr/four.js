/**
 * The §28 joint classes — `FixedJoint`, `HingeJoint`, `SliderJoint`,
 * `RopeJoint`, `SpringJoint`, `SphericalJoint` — and the world-to-local
 * conversion they are registered through (plan P6-1, P6-2, P6-3).
 *
 * §28 declares joints as classes constructed from the objects they constrain:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const hinge = new HingeJoint({
 *   bodyA, bodyB,
 *   anchor: new Vector3(0, 2, 0),
 *   axis: new Vector3(0, 0, 1),
 *   limits: { min: -Math.PI / 2, max: Math.PI / 2 },
 *   motor: { enabled: true, targetVelocity: 2, maxTorque: 50 },
 * });
 * world.addJoint(hinge);
 * ```
 *
 * This module is that surface. It holds **authored state only** — no solver
 * handle beyond the id the world binds, no simulation, no per-frame callbacks —
 * exactly like `RigidBody`, and produces a `JointDescriptor` when a world
 * registers it.
 *
 * ## A joint is not a component (plan P6-3)
 *
 * §6a gives a node one component per type; a joint spans **two** bodies and
 * belongs to neither node. So joints are registered with the world instead —
 * `world.addJoint(joint)` / `world.removeJoint(joint)` — which is also where
 * their solver lifetime naturally sits. `bodyA` and `bodyB` are the `RigidBody`
 * components §28's sketch names, not handles: a user has components, and the
 * world already knows which solver body each one is.
 *
 * ## Anchor and axis space (decision, WP-6.1 — pinned)
 *
 * Everything a joint class is constructed with is in **world space**, because
 * that is where §28's example puts it: `anchor` is the point in the scene where
 * the hinge pin goes and `axis` is the direction it points, both read off the
 * assembled mechanism. The descriptor a solver receives is in **body-local**
 * space, because that is what §37's descriptor says and what every solver wants.
 * The conversion happens **once, at `world.addJoint`**, against each body's pose
 * as the solver holds it at that moment:
 *
 * ```text
 * anchorLocalA = conj(rotationA) · (anchorWorld − positionA)
 * axisLocalA   = normalize(conj(rotationA) · axisWorld)
 * ```
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating plainly. First, **pose the bodies where they
 * belong before adding the joint**: a joint created while the mechanism is
 * disassembled bakes in the wrong local frames, exactly as it would in any
 * solver. Second, the descriptor is pose-independent afterwards, which is what
 * lets it be serialized, replayed (§34), and compared across adapters.
 *
 * ## What may change after registration (decision, WP-6.1)
 *
 * | Property                          | After registration                              |
 * | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
 * | `limits` (hinge, slider)          | {@link HingeJoint.setLimits}, queued            |
 * | `motor` (hinge, slider)           | {@link HingeJoint.setMotor}, queued             |
 * | `collisionEnabled`                | plain setter, queued (PH-22f, 2026-08-08)       |
 * | `breakForce` / `breakTorque`      | free — the engine enforces them                 |
 * | anchors, axis, rope, spring, cone | **frozen**; remove and re-add                   |
 *
 * Limits and motors are the two things §28's own example makes live ("limit
 * switches", a motor commanded to a new speed), and both are reconfigurable in
 * the solvers this repository ships, so they queue a command that the world
 * drains into `SolverJointAccess` at the next fixed step — the same
 * commands-not-mutations rule §26 imposes on forces, and for the same reason:
 * the solver may be mid-step and §6b forbids physics work during dispatch.
 * `collisionEnabled` joined them once the seam was checked property by property
 * rather than in bulk.
 *
 * ## Why the rest stays frozen — measured, 2026-08-08 (PH-22f)
 *
 * The 2026-08-01 staging note said "no adapter here can re-anchor or re-axis a
 * live constraint" and asked for a revisit. The revisit happened, against the
 * installed Rapier 0.19.3 typings and prototypes:
 *
 * | §28 property         | Rapier 0.19.3                                          | Verdict     |
 * | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
 * | `collisionEnabled`   | `ImpulseJoint.setContactsEnabled` — every type, both 2D/3D | **live**    |
 * | anchors              | `ImpulseJoint.setAnchor1` / `setAnchor2` exist          | staged (see below) |
 * | axis                 | no setter on any `ImpulseJoint` subclass                | frozen      |
 * | rope `maxLength`     | `RopeImpulseJoint` declares no members at all           | frozen      |
 * | spring rest/stiffness/damping | `SpringImpulseJoint` declares no members at all | frozen      |
 * | spherical swing cone | `SphericalImpulseJoint` declares no members at all      | frozen      |
 *
 * So the blanket statement was wrong for exactly two rows.
 * `collisionEnabled` is closed above. **Anchors are staged deliberately, not
 * for lack of a setter**: this module converts world-space anchors to
 * body-local frames *once, against the poses at `addJoint`* (see the section
 * above), and a live `setAnchors` has to answer which poses a re-anchor is
 * measured against — the poses now, or the poses the joint was built with.
 * That is a semantic decision, not a binding, and the two answers give
 * different mechanisms. It belongs to whichever packet also decides whether
 * §28 wants a body-local anchor API; until then `anchorA`/`anchorB` stay
 * `readonly`, and remove-and-re-add is the route.
 *
 * The frozen rows are frozen because changing them is not reconfiguration but a
 * different joint, and a setter that silently did nothing would be worse than
 * no setter. They are `readonly` **class fields**, so writing one is a compile
 * error rather than a runtime rejection — a failure at the earliest moment it
 * can be had. (Until PH-22f, `collisionEnabled` was the sole exception: a
 * mutable property with a runtime throw. Making it live retired both the throw
 * and the `#requireUnregistered` guard that existed only for it.)
 *
 * ## Breakage (plan P6-2)
 *
 * `breakForce` and `breakTorque` are enforced by `PhysicsWorld`, not by a
 * solver: the world reads the joint's reaction impulse after each fixed step,
 * divides by the delta, and destroys the joint when either magnitude *exceeds*
 * its threshold — emitting `"jointbreak"` **on the joint** after the step
 * (§6b, §39 step 9). {@link Joint.broken} stays `true` afterwards and the joint
 * cannot be registered again; build a new one.
