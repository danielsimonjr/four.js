/**
 * §27 force fields for rigid bodies, through §26's force API (PH-8,
 * 2026-08-09) — the engine occupant of §39's step 5, "force generation".
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { ForceFieldSystem } from "@four/physics";
 * import { dragField, radialField } from "@four/particles";
 *
 * const forces = new ForceFieldSystem({ worlds: [world] });
 * forces.addField(radialField(sunPosition, -6.7e2), "acceleration");
 * forces.addField(dragField(0.4), "acceleration");
 * app.systems.register(forces);          // priority 500, before the solve at 600
 * app.systems.register(new PhysicsSystem({ worlds: [world] }));
 * ```
 *
 * §26 declares six force and impulse methods and then lists the *generators*
 * that should drive them — "gravity; drag; springs; buoyancy; wind; magnetic
 * approximations; attractors; repulsors; custom fields". §27 gives those
 * generators one shape:
 *
 * ```ts
 * interface ForceField {
 *   sample(position: Vector3, velocity: Vector3, time: number, out?: Vector3): Vector3;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Both halves already existed on their own: `RigidBody` has had the six §26
 * methods since Phase 5, and `@four/particles` has had §27's built-in field set
 * since WP-9.2. Nothing joined them — a field could push a *particle* and not a
 * *body*. {@link ForceFieldSystem} is the join, and it is the whole of this
 * module: sample every registered field at every dynamic body once per fixed
 * step, sum, and hand the total to `RigidBody.applyForce`.
 *
 * ## Why a system and not a step inside `PhysicsWorld`
 *
 * Because §39 already says where this goes. Step 5 is "force generation" and
 * step 6 is "physics solve"; `@four/motion` publishes them as
 * `PRIORITY_FORCES` (500) and `PRIORITY_PHYSICS_SOLVE` (600), and
 * `PhysicsSystem` occupies the second. So force generation is a **separate
 * system at the priority §39 gave it**, and three properties follow for free:
 *
 * 1. **`world.step` is not edited.** Fields reach the solver through the same
 *    §26 command buffer user code uses, which the world drains at the top of
 *    its next step. Every existing determinism golden is untouched *by
 *    construction* rather than by measurement, and an application that does not
 *    register this system issues exactly the solver-call sequence it issued
 *    before this module existed.
 * 2. **Time is injected, never read from a clock (§33).** §27's `time` argument
 *    is `context.time.simulationTime` — §9's simulation domain, the same clock
 *    the particle path samples fields on.
 * 3. **Ordering is explicit and configurable**, which is what §39 asks for: a
 *    second field system at `PRIORITY_FORCES + 10` runs after this one, and a
 *    force generator that must observe another's result can be ordered against
 *    it without either knowing the other exists.
 *
 * ## The cross-package contract: structural, with no new dependency edge
 *
 * {@link ForceField} is §27's interface transcribed member-for-member — the
 * same transcription `@four/particles`' `ParticleForceField` carries, whose own
 * module note anticipated this packet: *"if a later packet lands a general
 * `ForceField` in another package, the two can be reconciled without a rename
 * churn here. They are structurally identical, so any §27 field satisfies this
 * type without an adapter."* That is the reconciliation, and it is structural:
 * the frozen §3.1 dependency matrix has no `physics → particles` edge and this
 * module adds none. Every built-in field in `@four/particles` —
 * `uniformGravityField`, `radialField`, `vortexField`, `windField`,
 * `dragField`, `turbulenceField`, and `volumeField`'s inclusion wrapper — is
 * assignable to {@link ForceField} with no adapter, no cast, and no import in
 * either direction. `tests/integration/physics-force-fields.test.ts` is where
 * the two declarations are type-checked against each other, because it is the
 * only place both packages are importable.
 *
 * §27's "volume-based inclusion and filtering" needs nothing here for the same
 * reason: inclusion is a property of a *field*, and `volumeField(inner, volume)`
 * already composes it onto any conforming field.
 *
 * ## Units: `"force"` or `"acceleration"`, stated at registration (§41)
 *
 * {@link ForceFieldSystem.addField} takes the units as a **required** argument.
 * §27's own built-in list mixes the two — "uniform gravity" and "radial
 * gravity" are accelerations (m/s²), "wind" and "drag volume" are forces (N) —
 * and the two differ by a factor of the body's mass, which is 1 for a particle
 * and anything at all for a body. `@four/particles` documents its fields as
 * accelerations because MVP particles carry no mass channel; handing one of
 * them to a system that assumed newtons would be a silent unit error on exactly
 * the reuse path this module advertises. A required argument makes that error
 * unwritable rather than merely documented, which is §41's SI envelope applied
 * to a seam instead of to a number.
 *
 * Everything here is SI (§41, §7a): newtons, kilograms, m/s², seconds, radians,
 * right-handed Y-up in 2D and 3D alike. §40's unit system is display-only and
 * is not consulted.
 *
 * ## What this module deliberately does not do
 *
 * - **Torque is optional.** §27's `sample` stays one linear vector so a
 *   particle field remains assignable. {@link ForceField.sampleTorque} is
 *   the angular channel, always in N·m, omitted by every built-in that has
 *   no reason to twist a body.
 * - **No transform writes, and no §42 authority check.** A force is not a
 *   transform write: the solver stays the single writer under `"physics"`
 *   authority and §26 is the sanctioned channel for influencing it (`RigidBody`
 *   says so in as many words). Warning here would fire on the one legitimate
 *   way to push a physics-owned body.
 * - **Sleeping bodies stay asleep unless an entry opts in.** See
 *   {@link ForceFieldAddOptions.wakesSleepingBodies}.
 * - **No `"local-plane"` sampling (§8).** A body's sample point is its
 *   world-space centre of mass, because that is the frame every registered body
 *   is in — `PhysicsWorld.addBody` refuses any other (PH-12).

 *
 * Structurally identical to `@four/particles`' `ParticleForceField`, so a field
 * written for either pillar works in both (module header). Contract for an
 * implementation, restated from §27 and the particle transcription so that a
 * reader of this package alone has all of it:
 *
 * - **Do not mutate `position` or `velocity`.** They are the caller's scratch
 *   copies of the body's live state.
 * - **Write into `out` when it is supplied and return it** — the system always
 *   supplies one, and doing so is what keeps the step allocation-free (§7b).
 *   Returning a *different* vector is legal (the caller reads the return value,
 *   never `out`), but that vector must stay valid until the next call.
 * - **`out` is not zeroed** by the caller. Write every component.
 * - **Be a pure function of its arguments** (§33). No clock — the absolute
 *   simulation time arrives as `time`, in seconds. No `Math.random` — take a
 *   `SeededRandom` at construction if the field is procedural.
 *
 * A field that returns a non-finite component poisons the body it is sampled
 * at; nothing here checks, for the same reason nothing checks in the particle
 * path — the check would run per body per field per step, and §85's place for
 * it is the field's own constructor.
 *
 * {@link ForceField.sampleAll} is the optional §27 batch fast path (R-34's
 * particle spelling, reused here so a field written for either pillar keeps
 * one identity). {@link ForceFieldSystem} calls it when a field offers it;
 * {@link ForceField.sample} stays the required §27 entry point.

   * ```
   *
   * ## The sample point is the centre of mass, not the transform origin
   *
   * §26 splits `applyForce` from `applyForceAtPoint`, and this is the former:
   * the force acts at the centre of mass and induces no torque. Sampling at the
   * point the force acts at is the only choice that keeps a field's answer and
   * its effect describing the same place — for an off-centre or compound body
   * (§24) the transform origin can be anywhere, including outside the shape.
   * `PhysicsWorld.forEachActiveBody` reads it from the solver, and is also
   * where the "dynamic and awake" filter and its §22/§32 arguments live.
   *
   * ## Velocity is the start-of-step value, and it is copied
   *
   * `RigidBody.linearVelocity` is refreshed from the solver in the previous
   * step's publish pass, so a velocity-dependent field (drag, wind) sees the
   * state the step begins in — the same rule the particle path states, and what
   * makes a drag field's closed form checkable. The copy costs one vector write
   * per body and makes §27's "do not mutate `velocity`" advisory rather than
   * load-bearing: a badly written field corrupts this system's scratch instead
   * of the component's mirror of solver state.
   *
   * ## Sleeping and non-dynamic bodies are skipped unless an entry opts in
   *
   * By `forEachActiveBody`, which states the argument: a force on a static or
   * kinematic body does nothing, and `RigidBody.applyForce` does **not**
   * implicitly wake a sleeper (WP-5.2). A persistent field (gravity, wind)
   * that visited every sleeper and then called `wake()` would defeat §32.
   * The opt-in is per-entry {@link ForceFieldAddOptions.wakesSleepingBodies}:
   * only those fields walk `forEachSleepingDynamicBody`, and only a non-zero
   * contribution calls `RigidBody.wake()`. Two entries that disagree do not
   * share a visit — the flag is not a system-wide OR.
   *
   * ## Allocation and cost
   *
   * Nothing is allocated after construction except the batched SoA scratch,
   * which grows to the next power of two that covers `world.size` the first
   * time a {@link ForceField.sampleAll} field meets that many registrations
   * and is then reused. A system with no fields, or with no tracked world,
   * does no solver call at all: the field list is tested before the worlds
   * are walked, so registering the system and using it later costs one
   * array-length comparison per step.
   *
   * ## Batching (optional {@link ForceField.sampleAll})
   *
   * When at least one registered field offers `sampleAll`, that world's
   * active bodies are gathered into stride-3 SoA buffers (binary64, so the
   * packed values equal `centerOfMass` / `linearVelocity` bit-for-bit) and
   * each such field is invoked once per step instead of once per body. A
   * field without the fast path is still sampled with {@link
   * ForceField.sample}, in its own place in the registration order, into
   * the same newton accumulator — one custom field neither reorders the
   * sum nor disables batching for its neighbours. Per-body summation order
   * is unchanged: field 0 then field 1 then field 2, which is why the
   * `force-fields` golden does not move.
