/**
 * The `Collider` component (§6a, §24) and its §25 effective-material
 * resolution.
 *
 * §24 declares the collider's fields — shape, offset, friction, restitution,
 * density, sensor flag, groups, mask — and §6a makes it a *component* attached
 * with `node.addComponent(new Collider(...))`. This module is that class. Like
 * `RigidBody` it holds authored state only: no solver handle, no contact
 * bookkeeping, no per-frame work (§6a).
 *
 * ## Which body a collider belongs to (decision, WP-5.2)
 *
 * §37's `ColliderDescriptor.body` is required — a collider is always part of a
 * body — but the *component* is constructed without one
 * ({@link ColliderOptions} is the descriptor minus that field) and resolves it
 * from the scene graph:
 *
 * 1. the `RigidBody` on the same node, if there is one;
 * 2. otherwise the nearest ancestor node's `RigidBody`.
 *
 * Resolution is **lazy** — {@link Collider.body} looks it up on every read, and
 * `onAttach` does not throw. Attach order is therefore free: `addComponent(new
 * Collider(...))` before or after `addComponent(new RigidBody(...))` both work,
 * and so does attaching the collider's node under a body node afterwards. §6a
 * fixes no ordering between components, so a hard failure at attach time would
 * turn a legal §6a sequence into an error the user cannot see in the API. The
 * failure instead surfaces at world registration through
 * {@link Collider.requireBody}, which throws a `FourError` naming the node —
 * the point at which the missing body genuinely blocks progress (WP-5.3).
 *
 * ## Several colliders on one body (§6a versus §24)
 *
 * §6a allows at most one component of a given type per node, and a body
 * routinely needs more than one collider. The resolution, in the order a user
 * should reach for it:
 *
 * 1. **child nodes.** The body node carries one collider; each additional
 *    collider lives on a child node, which finds the body by the ancestor walk
 *    above and whose transform is the collider's offset. This is the general
 *    answer and it needs no new concept: the scene graph already expresses
 *    "several shapes rigidly attached to one body".
 * 2. **compound shapes.** §24's `compound` shape puts several primitives in one
 *    collider. It is staged with the rest of the shape tier (plan P5-6) and
 *    will be the cheaper route for shapes that never move relative to each
 *    other.
 *
 * What is *not* the answer is relaxing §6a for this one component: a second
 * `Collider` on the same node replaces the first with a development warning,
 * exactly like every other component, so the failure is loud rather than a
 * silently ignored shape.
 *
 * ## Materials (§25)
 *
 * A collider may set `friction`, `restitution`, and `density` directly, point
 * at a shared {@link PhysicsMaterial}, or neither. The explicit field wins, the
 * material is the fallback, and a package default is the last resort — the rule
 * `ColliderDescriptor.material` states, implemented once in
 * {@link Collider.effectiveFriction}, {@link Collider.effectiveRestitution},
 * and {@link Collider.effectiveDensity} (the last through `resolveDensity`, so
 * §25's density sentence has exactly one implementation).
 *
 * ## Events (§29)
 *
 * `Collider` is an `EventEmitter` (§6b), so §29's `sensor.on("triggerenter",
 * …)` is literal. Collision events fire on the *body* (§29's `body.on(…)`);
 * trigger events fire on the sensor collider, which is the one the user
 * configured as a trigger volume. Emission is package-internal: `PhysicsSystem`
 * dispatches after the fixed step (§39 step 9), never during it.
 *
 * ## Dimension (§21, plan P5-3)
 *
 * A collider does not know which world it will join, so construction validates
 * the shape on its own (`validateCollisionShape` with no dimension) and the
 * remaining fields against the dimension the *shape* implies. The world's real
 * dimension is checked by {@link Collider.validateFor} at registration, which
 * is where a `"circle"` in a `"3d"` world is rejected.
