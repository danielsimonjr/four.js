/**
 * The `RigidBody` component (§6a, §23) and its §26 force/impulse command
 * buffers.
 *
 * §23 declares the body as a class with mass and state properties, `wake()` /
 * `sleep()`, and the six §26 force and impulse methods; §6a makes it a
 * *component* attached with `node.addComponent(new RigidBody(...))` rather than
 * a `Node` subclass. This module is that class. It holds **authored state
 * only** — no solver handle, no simulation, no per-frame callbacks (§6a: "per
 * frame work is driven by systems"). `PhysicsWorld` and `PhysicsSystem`
 * (WP-5.3) read this state, create the solver body from
 * {@link RigidBody.toDescriptor}, consume the command buffers once per fixed
 * step, and write the solved pose back under `"physics"` transform authority
 * (§42).
 *
 * ## Pose lives on the node, not here
 *
 * §23's property list has no position or rotation: a node's `Transform` (§7) is
 * its pose, and exactly one system owns it (§42). The component therefore keeps
 * only the *initial* pose a descriptor happened to carry
 * ({@link RigidBody.initialPosition}, {@link RigidBody.initialRotation}), so a
 * descriptor round-trips through the component unchanged.
 *
 * ## Authored state versus solved state — read this before writing a field
 *
 * The component's state reaches the solver **at registration**: `addBody` calls
 * {@link RigidBody.toDescriptor} once and the adapter builds its body from that
 * record. What happens to a write *after* that depends on the property and on
 * whether the world's adapter implements `SolverBodyTuningAccess` — the §37
 * seam for post-registration property changes, widened 2026-08-07 (PH-1
 * stage 2). Precisely (this header claimed the opposite until 2026-08-06, when
 * the "nothing is pushed" column below was written; the "live" column is
 * stage 2 making that column false on purpose):
 *
 * | State | Adapter with `SolverBodyTuningAccess` | Adapter without |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | {@link RigidBody.mass} (to a number) | **live** — queued on assignment, pushed as §23's whole triple at the top of the next fixed step | component only; warns once |
 * | {@link RigidBody.centerOfMass}, {@link RigidBody.inertiaTensor} | **live** on a body whose mass is **authored**, and only via {@link RigidBody.markMassPropertiesChanged} or a `mass` write — both are edited in place, so no setter can see them, and §23 has no distribution to set without a mass | component only; warns once when marked |
 * | {@link RigidBody.linearDamping}, {@link RigidBody.angularDamping} | **live** (one call for the pair) | component only; warns once |
 * | {@link RigidBody.gravityScale} | **live** | component only; warns once |
 * | {@link RigidBody.ccdMode}, {@link RigidBody.continuousCollisionDetection} | **live**, carrying {@link RigidBody.ccdPredictionDistance} | component only; warns once |
 * | `mass = undefined` (un-authoring) | **nothing** — see below; warns once | nothing; warns once |
 * | {@link RigidBody.linearVelocity} / {@link RigidBody.angularVelocity} | **solver → component** in the publish pass, for every body type. Fed *into* the solver only for a `"kinematic-velocity"` body (§22), which is the one type whose authored velocity is an input. A write on a dynamic body is therefore overwritten by the next step. | unchanged |
 * | {@link RigidBody.type} | component only; warns once. `PhysicsWorld.setBodyControlMode` moves both (§22, plan P7-3). | same |
 * | {@link RigidBody.sleeping} | solver → component (§32). | same |
 * | §26 forces and impulses, `wake()` / `sleep()` | component → solver, once per fixed step, through the command buffers below — the supported way to influence a running body. | same |
 *
 * The **live** rows set a bit in {@link RigidBody.pendingSolverWrites} and cost
 * nothing further; `PhysicsWorld.step` drains the bit set before it applies
 * forces, so the new property is in force for the step that follows the write.
 * A body nobody wrote to makes no extra solver call, which is why turning this
 * on moved no §33 golden.
 *
 * The **warns once** rows keep stage 1's machinery unchanged: the warning fires
 * only when the body is a registered dynamic one **and** the assignment really
 * changes the value (a self-assignment desynchronizes nothing, and the warning
 * is one-shot per body per field — spending it on a no-op would silence the
 * write that follows). It names the two routes that always work: re-register
 * the body (`removeBody` → `addBody`, which rebuilds the descriptor), or reach
 * the solver directly through `PhysicsWorld.getBodyHandle(node)`. A body
 * registered with two worlds warns unless *both* adapters can carry the write
 * (see {@link RigidBody.liveSolverWriteWorldCount}).
 *
 * The §23 mass triple has two more rules. First: a body that never named a
 * mass, a centre of mass, or an inertia tensor is asking the solver to derive
 * all three from collider density and geometry (§23, §25), so
 * {@link RigidBody.toDescriptor} omits what was never authored rather than
 * presenting a default as an instruction. See
 * {@link RigidBody.centerOfMassAuthored} and {@link RigidBody.massAuthored}.
 * Second, and the reason `mass = undefined` has its own row: going *back* to a
 * derived mass means restoring every collider's own density, which only the
 * registration path holds — no seam widening changes that, so it is stated as
 * permanently unreachable rather than staged.
 *
 * ## Commands, not mutations (§26, §32)
 *
 * A force applied by user code cannot reach the solver at the moment of the
 * call — the solver may be mid-step, and §6b forbids physics work during
 * dispatch. Every §26 method therefore **accumulates into a command buffer**
 * that the world drains at the next fixed step, and `wake()` / `sleep()` queue
 * a flag rather than editing {@link RigidBody.sleeping}. See
 * {@link RigidBodyCommands} for the exact clearing semantics.
 *
 * ## Blend weights (§19)
 *
 * {@link RigidBody.physicsWeight} and {@link RigidBody.animationWeight} are
 * §19's two sliders, verbatim from its sketch. They are **engine state, not
 * solver state**: no solver is told about them, {@link RigidBody.toDescriptor}
 * does not carry them, and they change nothing until a node declares
 * `"blended"` transform authority (§42) and the §19 blend system (WP-7.3) reads
 * them. See {@link RigidBody.normalizedWeights}.
 *
 * ## Events (§29, §32)
 *
 * `RigidBody` *is* an `EventEmitter` (§6b), so §29's `body.on("collisionstart",
 * …)` is literal. The emit side is **package-internal**: `PhysicsSystem`
 * normalizes the adapter's `drainEvents` output and emits after the fixed step
 * (§39 step 9). User code subscribes; nothing outside `@four/physics` should
 * call `emit` for these types.
 *
 * ## Dimension (§21, plan P5-3)
 *
 * A component does not know which world it will join, so construction-time
 * validation runs against `"3d"`, the permissive dimension: it adds no rules of
 * its own, so construction performs exactly the dimension-independent checks.
 * The `"2d"` plane constraints are checked by {@link RigidBody.validateFor}
 * when the body is registered with a world, which is the first moment the
 * dimension is known. `Vector2` arguments widen to `z = 0` everywhere (P5-3).

 *   call `applyForce` every step (from a `fixedUpdate` listener, §10) — the
 *   buffer is empty again by the time the next step begins;
 * - an **impulse** is a one-shot change of momentum. Applying it once is
 *   enough, and the same clearing rule guarantees it is not applied twice.
 *
 * ## Point loads are pooled
 *
 * `pointForces` and `pointImpulses` are pools that grow to the high-water mark
 * of a single step and never shrink; only the first `pointForceCount` /
 * `pointImpulseCount` entries are live. Clearing resets the counts, not the
 * arrays, so a steady-state body accumulating point loads every step allocates

   * ## Why the distinction has to exist
   *
   * §23 derives a body's mass from collider density times volume whenever
   * `mass` is not authored, and a solver derives the centre of mass and the
   * rotational inertia from the same geometry in the same breath — mass,
   * centre, and inertia are one triple. Naming any part of that triple means

   * asked for a distribution with no mass to distribute has nothing to do but
   * refuse.
   *
   * ## The rule, and why it cannot silently drop what a caller asked for
   *
   * A centre of mass counts as authored when **either** holds:
   *
   * 1. the constructor descriptor carried `centerOfMass` (whatever its value,
   *    including the origin), or {@link RigidBody.markCenterOfMassAuthored}
   *    has been called — the sticky half;
   * 2. {@link RigidBody.centerOfMass} is not at the origin right now — the
   *    live half, which catches `body.centerOfMass.set(…)` after construction
   *    without asking the caller to announce it.
   *
   * The union is what makes the omission safe. Rule 1 keeps an explicitly
   * authored origin — the one value rule 2 cannot see — and rule 2 keeps every
   * post-construction edit. The only state that is omitted is a centre that is
   * at the origin *and* was never mentioned, which is precisely the state that
   * carries no instruction. `-0` reads as the origin (`-0 !== 0` is `false`),
   * and a non-finite component reads as authored, so §85 validation rejects it
   * rather than the descriptor quietly losing it.
   *
   * The one case rule 2 alone would get wrong is "pin the centre to the origin
   * even though the colliders sit off it", which is a real instruction that
   * looks identical to the default. Authoring `centerOfMass` in the descriptor
   * states it; {@link RigidBody.markCenterOfMassAuthored} states it after the
