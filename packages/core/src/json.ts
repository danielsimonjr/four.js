/**
 * JSON value typing and validation shared by every document format (§34, §79).
 *
 * Both persistence surfaces in the engine — `@four/diagnostics`' §34 replay
 * envelope and `@four/serialization`'s §79 scene document — are JSON on the
 * wire, and both need the same two things: a type that says "representable
 * JSON, nothing else" ({@link JsonValue}) and a validating deep-copy that
 * enforces it ({@link cloneJsonValue}). Each package originally carried its own
 * copy because the §3.1 dependency matrix puts them side by side with no edge
 * between them; both copies carried a dated note naming the hoist into
 * `@four/core` as the fix. This module is that hoist (2026-08-04): one
 * definition, below every consumer, re-exported unchanged by both packages.
 *
 * The consolidated {@link cloneJsonValue} is `@four/serialization`'s variant —
 * the diagnostics original **plus** the `__proto__` refusal — because the
 * strengthening is correct everywhere: `JSON.parse` makes `__proto__` an
 * ordinary own property, and copying it with `copy[key] = …` would run the
 * inherited setter and re-parent the fresh object instead of storing a key —
 * silently losing the value and handing the caller an object with a surprising
 * prototype. Nothing legitimate needs that key, so it is refused, and every
 * consumer downstream can assign keys without a guard.

 * `NaN`) is not representable, and it is better to say so in the type than to
