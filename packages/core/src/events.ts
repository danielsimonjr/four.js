/**
 * Typed event emitter (§6b).
 *
 * One event API serves nodes and the application. `EventEmitter` is the shared
 * implementation: `@four/scene`'s `Node` extends it (plan D1), and the
 * application composition root re-emits `fixedUpdate` / `update` / `render`
 * through the same contract (§10).
 *
 * The four emitter-local rules of §6b, and how they are implemented here:
 *
 * 1. `on` returns an unsubscribe function; `once` removes the listener after
 *    exactly one delivery. The unsubscriber is idempotent.
 * 2. Listeners fire in registration order.
 * 3. Listeners added or removed during a dispatch take effect from the next
 *    dispatch: `emit` iterates a snapshot of the listener list taken before the
 *    first listener runs. A listener removed during the dispatch is still
 *    skipped (its record is flagged), because "removed" must mean "will not be
 *    called again"; a listener *added* during the dispatch is not called until
 *    the next dispatch of that type.
 * 4. An event does not re-enter its own dispatch. Emitting the *same* type
 *    while that type is dispatching does not recurse: the event is queued and
 *    delivered after the in-flight dispatch of that type completes, in emission
 *    order. (Decision, WP-1.4: queue-and-defer rather than throw or drop —
 *    §6b forbids re-entrancy but the spec describes no error, and dropping the
 *    event would silently lose state changes. Emitting a *different* type from
 *    within a dispatch is not re-entrancy and is delivered immediately.)
