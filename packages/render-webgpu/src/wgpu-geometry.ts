/**
 * Per-device store of uploaded geometry (§61, §64 stage 7) — the WebGPU twin of
 * `gl-geometry.ts`'s `GeometryCache`.
 *
 * The pattern is §61's recorded design and is not re-argued here: `Texture` and
 * `BufferGeometry` are **CPU-side descriptors carrying an id and a version**,
 * GPU residency is a backend-owned cache keyed by that id, and a device loss is
 * handled by dropping the cache. That design is the reason a second backend is
 * cheap, and this class is the smallest possible demonstration of it.
 *
 * ## What differs from the GL twin, and what does not
 *
 * *Does not*: the id/version contract, the eviction rule, the refusal to throw,
 * the fixed allocation order.
 *
 * *Does*: there is **no vertex array object**. WebGL 2 records attribute
 * bindings into a VAO so a draw is one `bindVertexArray`; WebGPU records them
 * into the *pipeline* (`wgpu-pipeline-cache.ts`) and binds raw buffers per
 * draw. So a record here is buffers and counts, and the attribute layout it
 * would have carried lives in the pipeline descriptor instead. That is the
 * structural difference between the two APIs, and it is why this file is half
 * the length of the one it ports.
 *
 * Uploads use `queue.writeBuffer`, which copies immediately from the caller's
 * typed array — so a geometry mutated after the call is not read back, and the
 * `version` bump is what re-uploads it.
 *
 * This cache uploads **positions, optional normals, optional uvs, optional
 * colours and optional indices**: exactly the streams this package's pipelines
 * draw. Uvs joined in WP-R1.2, with the textured variant that reads them.
 * Normals joined in WP-R1.5 with the lit and standard pipelines — and joined
 * **per acquisition, not per geometry**: the caller states whether the draw at
 * hand shades (`acquire`'s second parameter), and the stream uploads on the
 * first acquisition that says so. The rule stands — a stream is uploaded when
 * a pipeline can read it, never before — and it is applied per *draw kind*
 * rather than per package on purpose: a normal-carrying geometry drawn only
 * unlit (`planeGeometry` under an `UnlitMaterial`, every §55 sprite quad)
 * would otherwise upload a buffer nothing ever binds, and every landed
 * pre-WP-R1.5 transcript would move. (The GL cache uploads normals
 * unconditionally because its VAO records all streams at once; here a record
 * is loose buffers, so the honest unit of need is the draw.)
