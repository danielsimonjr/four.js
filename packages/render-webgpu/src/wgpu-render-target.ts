/**
 * GPU-side render targets for the WebGPU backend: one colour (and optional
 * depth) allocation per `@four/render` `RenderTarget`, cached and invalidated
 * by version (§61, §48, §63; WP-R1.6).
 *
 * The fourth member of the family `wgpu-geometry.ts` and `wgpu-texture.ts`
 * continue — same key (`id`), same validator (`version`), same lazy eviction,
 * same loss-aware {@link WgpuRenderTargetCache.forget}, same refusal to throw
 * inside `render` — and the WebGPU twin of `gl-render-target.ts`, whose module
 * header carries the family argument in full. What is stated here is only what
 * the port could not transliterate: the format table, and the two places
 * WebGPU's object model differs from a framebuffer's.
 *
 * ## The format decisions, as data
 *
 * Every format this cache allocates is a named constant below, resolved by
 * {@link renderTargetDepthFormat} — a table, not a scatter of string literals,
 * for the reason `wgpu-bindings.ts` declares layouts as data: a later packet
 * (R1.7's shadow sampling, the R-4 float-format widening) targets the table
 * rather than re-deriving it.
 *
 * - **Colour is {@link RENDER_TARGET_COLOR_FORMAT} (`rgba8unorm`)** — not the
 *   swap chain's preferred `bgra8unorm`. The engine's `"rgba8"` descriptor
 *   means *eight-bit unsigned normalised colour* and channel order is a
 *   backend detail (`webgpu-renderer.ts`'s §60a note), so the backend picks
 *   the order that costs least: `rgba8unorm` is guaranteed renderable and
 *   sampleable on every device, and `readPixels` then returns bytes in the
 *   R,G,B,A order §61's callers (and GL's `readPixels`) expect, with no
 *   swizzle pass. The consequence is that off-screen pipelines carry a
 *   different `colorFormat` than on-screen ones — which is exactly what the
 *   per-format pipeline cache exists to absorb, and why an application's first
 *   off-screen frame compiles its variants a second time.
 * - **A plain depth buffer is {@link RENDER_TARGET_DEPTH_FORMAT}
 *   (`depth24plus`)** — the same format the on-screen attachment uses, and
 *   WebGPU's spelling of "a depth buffer nothing reads" (GL's
 *   `DEPTH_COMPONENT16` renderbuffer; the byte accounting difference is
 *   `RenderTarget.byteLength`'s to describe, not this cache's to change).
 * - **A samplable depth attachment (`depthTexture: true`) is
 *   {@link RENDER_TARGET_DEPTH_TEXTURE_FORMAT} (`depth32float`)**, not
 *   `depth24plus`. The plan's wording allows either; `depth32float` is chosen
 *   because it is the depth format WebGPU guarantees can be both sampled
 *   (`sampleType: "depth"`) *and* copied out of (`copyTextureToBuffer`
 *   forbids the `depth24plus` depth aspect as a copy source), and because its
 *   four bytes per texel are exactly what R-18's accounting already bills for
 *   the samplable form. It is allocated with `TEXTURE_BINDING`, because being
 *   sampled later is the option's whole meaning (§69) — binding it is R1.7's
 *   packet (a depth comparison is a distinct binding type).
 * - **A stencilled target is {@link RENDER_TARGET_DEPTH_STENCIL_FORMAT}
 *   (`depth24plus-stencil8`)** — WebGPU's spelling of the packed
 *   `DEPTH24_STENCIL8` the GL backend allocates, and the reason §67's
 *   `stencil` ⊥ `depthTexture` exclusivity **survives the port for an
 *   independent reason** (the R-1 plan's §3.3.6): a combined-aspect texture
 *   cannot serve as the general samplable depth attachment, so the constraint
 *   two backends reach independently is a design, not an accident of GL.
 *
 * The colour allocation always carries `RENDER_ATTACHMENT | TEXTURE_BINDING |
 * COPY_SRC`: a target exists to be drawn into, then sampled (R-4's
 * render-to-texture point) or read back (§61's `readPixels`), and one usage
 * set keeps the format table one row per format instead of one per consumer.
 *
 * ## What one entry holds, and the two structural differences from GL
 *
 * A record holds the colour texture and its view, the optional depth texture
 * and its view, and the size and format facts frame code reads off the
 * *record* rather than off the `RenderTarget` — so the `setViewport` call and
 * the allocation agree even if the application resized the target after the
 * frame began (`gl-render-target.ts`'s rule, unchanged).
 *
 * 1. **There is no framebuffer object and no completeness check.** A WebGPU
 *    render pass binds views directly, and `createTexture` on a guaranteed
 *    format does not fail synchronously — allocation failure surfaces through
 *    the device's error scopes and draws nothing, which satisfies §61's
 *    no-throw rule by construction. `acquire` therefore returns `null` only
 *    for a disposed target or a disposed cache.
 * 2. **Sampling state is an object, and the sampling bind group is lazy.**
 *    GL writes `LINEAR`/`CLAMP_TO_EDGE` onto the colour texture at allocation;
 *    here the equivalent is a bind group over the texture cache's group layout
 *    (the *same* layout object every `map` pipeline was compiled against —
 *    the WP-R1.2 provider rule) with one shared linear-clamped sampler.
 *    Both are created by the first frame that actually **samples** a target
 *    ({@link WgpuRenderTargetCache.sample}), never at allocation — a target
 *    that is only ever drawn into and read back records no sampler, no
 *    layout, and no bind group at all (the lazy-everything discipline).
