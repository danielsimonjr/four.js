/**
 * §65 batching for the WebGPU backend — the GPU half of `@four/render`'s
 * {@link RenderBatcher}, and the twin of `@four/render-webgl`'s `gl-batch.ts`
 * (WP-R1.3).
 *
 * The planner is untouched and unshared-code: `batch.ts` decides which
 * consecutive draws merge — clip-record boundaries included (R-23) — and
 * produces one interleaved vertex stream plus one index stream. This module
 * owns the GPU buffers those streams are uploaded into and issues the single
 * `drawIndexed` that replaces the run. Nothing here decides what may batch;
 * read `batch.ts`'s header for the tier and `gl-batch.ts`'s for why batching
 * is opt-in (the measured pipeline-cost law — `WebgpuRenderer` names this
 * module `import type` only, so an application that never calls
 * {@link createWgpuBatching} pays zero bytes for it).
 *
 * ```ts
 * const renderer = new WebgpuRenderer();
 * await renderer.initialize({ canvas });
 * renderer.batching = createWgpuBatching();   // §65, opt in
 * ```
 *
 * ## The one structural difference from the GL twin: a buffer pair per batch
 *
 * `GlBatching` reuses **one** vertex/index buffer pair for every batch of a
 * frame, because GL executes `bufferSubData` and `drawElements` in issue
 * order — each batch's upload lands before its draw runs. WebGPU cannot reuse
 * one pair that way: `queue.writeBuffer` executes in **queue** order, before
 * the frame's `submit`, so a second batch's upload into a shared buffer would
 * overwrite the first batch's data before the first batch's recorded draw ever
 * executes. So this module keeps a **buffer pair per batch slot**: batch *k*
 * of a frame draws from pair *k*, uploaded immediately (nothing else writes
 * that pair this frame) and reused by batch *k* of every later frame.
 * {@link WgpuRenderBatching.beginFrame} is what resets the slot counter, and
 * it is the one contract member the GL interface does not need.
 *
 * The steady state is the GL one's: one `writeBuffer` pair per batch per
 * frame, zero allocations. §65's *"persistent mapped or staged buffers"* —
 * a staging ring that would collapse the per-batch uploads into one — becomes
 * reachable at this seam for the first time and is deliberately **noted, not
 * built**: it is its own packet (R-1 plan, WP-R1.3).
 *
 * ## Growth is safe mid-frame, and the reason is worth stating
 *
 * A slot's buffers grow when this frame's batch *k* outgrows them. The old
 * buffer's last use was batch *k* of a *previous* frame, whose `submit` has
 * long since been called, so `destroy()` at growth time is safe — unlike the
 * shared-pair design, where growth would destroy a buffer the current pass
 * already references. Growth sizes the new buffer to the planner's whole
 * staging array (the size `gl-batch.ts` gives `bufferData`), so the arrays
 * double-and-stop behaviour upstream bounds allocations here too.
 *
 * ## What one draw becomes
 *
 * A batch draws through the **unlit shader family**, whatever pipeline its
 * items came from — `gl-batch.ts`'s argument verbatim: a sprite batch carries
 * uv per vertex and uploads the material's tint as the draw colour, and the
 * fragment product `color × texture` is the sprite pipeline's product in the
 * opposite, commutative order. What *is* new here is that WebGPU bakes the
 * vertex layout into the pipeline, so a batch cannot reuse the unlit
 * pipelines' separate-stream layouts: the renderer asks the pipeline cache for
 * a `kind: "batch"` variant whose one vertex buffer is the planner's
 * interleaved stream ({@link batchVertexBufferLayout}), compiled from the same
 * WGSL modules the unlit pipelines share.
 *
 * ## Device loss (§61)
 *
 * {@link WgpuRenderBatching.forget} drops every handle without calling
 * `destroy()` — the allocations belong to a device that no longer exists —
 * and {@link WgpuRenderBatching.dispose} destroys them on a live one, exactly
 * as every cache in this backend does. A *new* device arriving through
 * {@link WgpuRenderBatching.draw} resets the pool the way `GlBatching` resets
 * on a new context.
