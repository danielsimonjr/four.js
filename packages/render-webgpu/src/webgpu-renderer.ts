/**
 * Draws four.js scenes with WebGPU (§61, §62 backend 1).
 *
 * ```ts
 * const renderer = new WebgpuRenderer();
 * await renderer.initialize({ canvas });
 * renderer.resize(800, 600, devicePixelRatio);
 * renderer.render(scene, [createFullscreenViewport(camera)]);
 * // …
 * renderer.dispose();
 * ```
 *
 * This is WP-R1.1 through WP-R1.7 of the R-1 plan: device and context
 * acquisition, the registry opt-in, per-view clears, the **unlit** tier —
 * flat, vertex-coloured and §57-`map`-textured — plus WP-R1.3's **sprite**
 * pipeline (§55; §56's `Text` needs nothing more — a label is one textured
 * unlit draw, R-28), the opt-in §65 **batching** uploader (`wgpu-batch.ts`),
 * §67's **clip** application (masks write stencil bit planes, clipped
 * draws test them — see `DEPTH_STENCIL_FORMAT` below for the per-frame
 * stencil-format decision), WP-R1.5's two **shaded** tiers — §68's
 * Lambert `lit` family and §59's metallic-roughness `standard` family, both
 * under one per-view light uniform block (`wgpu-lights.ts`) — and WP-R1.6's
 * off-screen tier: **render targets** (`wgpu-render-target.ts`, sampled back
 * through R-4's `resolveTexture` seam with the same feedback refusal), §70's
 * **effects** (`renderEffect`, `wgpu-effect.ts`), and §61's **`readPixels`**
 * (`wgpu-readback.ts` — the whole-target, honestly asynchronous form). All of
 * it drawn through the real `buildRenderList` → `buildViewRenderList` → draw
 * path; WP-R1.4 added no pipeline — §50 shapes and §58 paints were already
 * ordinary unlit draws, and that packet's deliverable is the
 * transcript-identity tests saying so. WP-R1.7 lands §69's **shadow** tier
 * (`wgpu-shadow.ts`: a depth-only caster pass into the renderer's own
 * samplable target, the comparison-sampler bindings, and a lazy `shadow`
 * variant of both shaded families) and completes §57 **stencil parity**
 * (`wgpu-stencil.ts`: R-7's mask-by-hand tier now selects the stencil format
 * on clipless frames too). WP-R1.8 lands §36's **particle** pipeline
 * (`wgpu-particles.ts`: the instanced billboard port of `gl-particles.ts`,
 * one draw per system over the shared unit quad and a per-system instance
 * buffer) and §82's **compute** tier (`wgpu-compute.ts`: `compute()`,
 * `createComputeBuffer`/`writeComputeBuffer`/`readComputeBuffer`, and the
 * §36 GPU particle integrator kernel — the first capability of this backend
 * WebGL 2 structurally cannot mirror). WP-R1.9 lands §60's **node
 * materials** and §70's **`"graph"` effect** (RFC 0001's WGSL emitter,
 * `wgpu-node-program.ts`, reached only through the
 * `registerWebgpuNodeMaterialPipeline()` seam in `wgpu-node-registry.ts`).
 * The remaining pipelines (RFC 0003's `skinned-unlit`/`skinned-lit`, which
 * need a joint-palette pipeline this backend does not stage yet) are
 * *absent*, not stubbed: an item this tier cannot draw is skipped, exactly
 * as a draw with no geometry record is, because a pipeline that silently
 * draws the wrong thing is worse than one that does not exist yet (the
 * recorded WP-9.1 rule, applied to a backend) — and an *unregistered* node
 * material is skipped on the same terms. The one exception is deliberate and
 * narrow: a §67 **mask** is coverage, not shading, so a clip node of any
 * material family masks correctly today through the flat unlit pipeline with
 * colour writes off.
 *
 * ## `initialize()` finally earns its `Promise`
 *
 * `Renderer.initialize` has always been typed `Promise<void>`; `WebglRenderer`
 * fulfils it synchronously because `getContext` returns immediately. WebGPU
 * cannot: `requestAdapter` and `requestDevice` are genuinely asynchronous, and
 * this is the first implementation for which awaiting is not a formality. Every
 * failure along the way — no `navigator.gpu`, no adapter, no device, no canvas,
 * no `"webgpu"` context — rejects with a `FourError` carrying
 * `RENDERER_INITIALIZATION_FAILED` (§89), never a silent downgrade: §62 puts
 * backend *selection* and its fallback in the registry, not in a backend.
 *
 * ## Device loss is a promise, not an event pair (§61)
 *
 * WebGL 2 signals loss with two canvas events and needs `preventDefault()` on
 * the first of them to be promised a restore. WebGPU signals it with
 * `device.lost`, a promise on the device — a better fit for §61's "first-class
 * event, not an error case", and the reason `WebgpuCanvas` needs no event
 * target at all. On loss this renderer marks itself lost, drops every cache
 * (the allocations belong to a device that no longer exists) and emits
 * `contextlost`. It does **not** emit `contextrestored`: WebGPU has no
 * automatic restore — recovery is requesting a *new* device, which is an
 * application-level decision about whether to keep going — so promising a
 * restore this backend cannot deliver would be a lie the interface would carry
 * forever. `render` and `resize` return quietly while lost, as §61 requires.
 *
 * ## Colour space and the swap-chain format (§60a)
 *
 * The canvas is configured with the host's **preferred** format, which is
 * `"bgra8unorm"` on most hosts and **not** `"rgba8unorm"`. That never widens
 * `RenderTargetFormat`: the engine's `"rgba8"` means *eight-bit unsigned
 * normalised colour*, and channel order is a backend detail. A later reader
 * looking to "fix" the mismatch should read that sentence twice — the
 * descriptor is not describing memory layout, it is describing precision.
 *
 * ## Clip depth (§3.3.8 of the R-1 plan)
 *
 * WebGPU's NDC depth is `[0, 1]`; `@four/math`'s projections are written to
 * WebGL's `[-1, 1]`. `Camera.updateProjectionMatrix` accepts `"zero-to-one"`
 * and would produce a native matrix — and this backend deliberately does not
 * call it. A renderer that rewrote an application-owned camera's projection
 * would corrupt any *other* renderer sharing that camera, and §61 is explicit
 * that rendering mutates nothing in the scene. So the remap is a
 * multiply-and-add in this backend's own vertex stage (`wgpu-unlit.ts`), the
 * frustum keeps culling against the un-remapped matrix in the one convention
 * both backends share, and the camera is left exactly as the application set
 * it.

 *
 * **Per frame, not always** — the R-6 pipeline-cost law applied to a format:
 * the depth format is baked into every pipeline, so allocating stencil
 * unconditionally would re-key (and recompile) every pipeline of every
 * application and move every landed transcript's `createTexture` and
 * `createRenderPipeline` lines. Instead the frame asks `frameWantsStencil`
 * (WP-R1.7, `wgpu-stencil.ts`) — R-23's O(1) clip read plus a scan for §57
 * material stencils — and only a frame that actually masks pays for
 * stencil-carrying pipelines and the attachment's extra byte per pixel. A
 * scene that starts or stops masking reallocates the depth texture and
 * compiles the other format's pipelines once, which is the same class of
 * cost as its first frame; a scene that never masks records the WP-R1.1
 * transcript byte for byte.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no `stencil` renderer option and no no-stencil

 * is a context-creation attribute it cannot add after the fact, so a clip can
 * arrive on a surface that has nowhere to write its mask. This backend owns
 * its depth attachment and can always allocate the stencil aspect the frame
 * needs — the diagnostic's condition is unreachable, and an option would gate
 * something that costs nothing when unused. R1.3's recorded residue — §57
 * `material.stencil` inert on clipless frames — is retired by the same scan
 * (WP-R1.7): R-7's mask-by-hand tier reaches the hardware on any on-screen

   * Draws one §70 full-screen effect (WP-R1.6) — `pass.source`'s colour
   * attachment over the whole of `pass.target`, or of the swap chain, through
   * `pass.effect`. The normative contract is on `@four/render`'s
   * `Renderer.renderEffect`; the GL backend's method documents the shared
   * readings and this one differs in exactly two ways, both structural:
   *
   * - **There is no state envelope.** GL borrows the framebuffer binding, the
   *   rectangles, the depth test and a texture unit inside a `try`/`finally`;
   *   here the effect is its own render pass in its own command encoder, and
   *   a WebGPU pass has no ambient state to corrupt — the one place this
   *   backend is structurally safer, restated for §70. No scissor or viewport
   *   is set: a pass's defaults are the whole attachment, which is exactly
   *   what "an effect covers its destination surface" means.
   * - **The effect kind is pipeline identity, not uniform state** — a lazy
   *   per-(kind × format) pipeline (`wgpu-effect.ts` carries the inverted
   *   R-19 argument), so a chain that only ever copies compiles one module
   *   and uploads no uniforms at all; only a grade touches the 16-byte block.
   *
   * ## What is skipped rather than thrown (§61, §83)
   *
   * Everything, on `render`'s terms — a lost device, a source that is not a
   * render-target texture (a caller that bypassed `validateEffectRenderPass`),
   * a disposed source or destination, an effect kind this backend does not
   * draw (RFC 0001's `"graph"` kind is drawn since WP-R1.9, through the
   * registered node store; unregistered, it skips — the closed-union rule
   * either way), and the **feedback loop**: a pass
   * whose destination is the very surface it samples, refused here exactly as
   * R-4 refuses it per draw, with `RenderGraph.validate` reporting it
   * statically as `"feedback"` so the mistake is normally caught at setup.

   *   `depthLoadOp: "clear"` to the far plane is the whole-map clear GL
   *   spells as an opened scissor plus `clear(DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)`. The colour
   *   attachment loads: it is written by the caster stage and read by
   *   nothing (`wgpu-shadow.ts`).
   * - **It draws from the frame's list, in list order** — same items, same
   *   `worldMatrix`, including §43's interpolated pose — filtered to
   *   `castShadow` items of the kinds this backend draws; `wgpu-shadow.ts`'s
   *   header owns each exclusion. §46 layer masks are deliberately not
   *   applied (frame state must not depend on which viewport is first) and
   *   §67 clips cannot be (the map's format carries no stencil planes).
   * - **Caster blocks ride the frame's strided uniform buffer** — the
   *   light's matrix in the `viewProjection` slot, the caster's world matrix
   *   in `model`, the never-read colour as the mask draws' canonical zeros —
   *   so the pass needs no allocation of its own and the one
   *   `queue.writeBuffer` at the end of the frame covers it.
