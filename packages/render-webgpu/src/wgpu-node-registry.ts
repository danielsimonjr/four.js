/**
 * The WebGPU node-material pipeline's registration slot (§60, §62; RFC 0001;
 * WP-R1.9) — the lazily-filled module `let` that keeps the WGSL emitter and
 * the node pipeline store out of every bundle that never draws a node
 * material, this backend's twin of `@four/render-webgl`'s
 * `node-pipeline-registry.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why a registry slot, and why this module is nearly empty
 *
 * The pipeline-cost law (R-6, measured through RFC 0003 and RFC 0001):
 * anything `WebgpuRenderer` reaches statically rides in every bundle that
 * carries the class, because nothing reachable from a class method
 * tree-shakes. A WGSL emitter is the same class of mass the GLSL emitter was,
 * so it lives in `wgpu-node-program.ts`, which the renderer **never
 * imports** — it imports this module, whose whole content is one `let`, three
 * functions, and the interfaces the draw loop is typed against. An
 * application opts in with
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { registerWebgpuNodeMaterialPipeline } from "@four/render-webgpu";
 * registerWebgpuNodeMaterialPipeline();
 * ```
 *
 * Even registration compiles nothing: the factory creates a store, and a WGSL
 * module compiles per distinct graph on the first frame that needs it —
 * never at registration and never at renderer initialize — so a scene with no
 * node material records the byte-identical device transcript it always did
 * (RFC 0001's acceptance gate, restated for this backend and pinned in
 * `tests/integration/webgpu-node-materials.test.ts`).
 *
 * ## An unregistered node material is skipped, not drawn flat
 *
 * `WebgpuRenderer` resolves this slot on the first frame carrying a `"node"`
 * item (or a §70 `"graph"` effect); a `null` answer skips those draws with a
 * one-time §85 development warning naming the fix. Drawing flat instead was
 * rejected by RFC 0001 §4: a graph the author wrote is a specific picture.
