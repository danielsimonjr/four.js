/**
 * The skinning pipeline's registration slot (§54, §62; RFC 0003) — the
 * lazily-filled module `let` that keeps two skinned colour pipelines and a
 * joint-palette uploader out of every bundle that never skins.
 *
 * The pipeline-cost law (R-6), restated for this backend: `WebgpuRenderer`
 * imports **this** module — one `let`, three functions, and the interfaces
 * the draw loop is typed against — and never `wgpu-skinning.ts`; an
 * application opts in with
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { registerSkinningPipeline } from "@fourjs/render-webgpu";
 * registerSkinningPipeline();
 * ```
 *
 * which is what links the heavy module. The renderer resolves this slot on
 * the first skinned item of a frame; a `null` answer skips the draw with a
 * one-time §85 development warning naming the fix. Drawing the bind pose
 * instead was rejected by RFC 0003 §5: a character standing in T-pose is a
 * different picture, and the recorded rule is that a value must not become
 * one.
 *
 * This slice ships the **colour pair** (skinned unlit + skinned lit) plus
 * {@link SkinnedPrograms.acquireShadow} for the §69 caster, compiled on the
 * first skinned caster, never with the colour pair. The RFC 0005 id pass
 * lives in `wgpu-picking.ts` and does **not** import this module.
