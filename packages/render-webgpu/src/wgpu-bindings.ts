/**
 * This backend's binding layout, **declared as data** (§7 of the R-1 plan).
 *
 * A WGSL shader can declare its own bindings inline and let
 * `layout: "auto"` infer a pipeline layout from them. This backend refuses that
 * shortcut, and the refusal is a recorded debt to RFC 0001 rather than a style
 * preference: the RFC's future WGSL *emitter* will be a second producer of
 * shaders for this same backend, and two producers can only share a pipeline
 * layout if the layout exists somewhere other than inside a shader string. So
 * the layout is a TypeScript table here, every WGSL source in this package is
 * generated against it (`wgpu-unlit.ts`), and `layout: "auto"` appears nowhere.
 * It costs nothing today and saves the emitter from inventing a second
 * convention (decision, WP-R1.1).
 *
 * ## One uniform block per draw, one bind group per frame
 *
 * Every pipeline in this tier reads exactly one uniform buffer, at group 0,
 * binding 0, with a **dynamic offset**:
 *
 * ```wgsl
 * struct DrawUniforms {
 *   viewProjection : mat4x4<f32>,   //   0 .. 64
 *   model          : mat4x4<f32>,   //  64 .. 128
 *   color          : vec4<f32>,     // 128 .. 144
 * };
 * @group(0) @binding(0) var<uniform> draw : DrawUniforms;
 * ```
 *
 * The frame packs one such block per draw into a single growable CPU staging
 * array, uploads it with one `queue.writeBuffer`, creates **one** bind group,
 * and moves between draws with a dynamic offset. The alternatives were a bind
 * group per draw (an allocation per draw, per frame) or a uniform buffer per
 * draw (an allocation per object); this shape allocates once per *frame size*
 * and never inside a steady-state frame, which is the same rule §64's pooled
 * render items follow.
 *
 * The view-projection is duplicated into every draw's block rather than living
 * in a second, per-view bind group. That is 64 bytes per draw against a second
 * bind group, a second layout and a second binding index in every shader —
 * and the blocks are 256-byte-strided anyway (see `UNIFORM_STRIDE_BYTES`), so
 * the duplication is free in allocated bytes. When a per-view group earns its
 * keep — the lit pipeline's light block is the first candidate (WP-R1.5) — it
 * arrives as group 1, and this group's layout does not move.

/**
 * The texture/sampler bind-group layout (§77, WP-R1.2).
 *
 * ## Why the two bindings are one group, and why the group is a *second* one
 *
 * They are one group because they are one decision — "sample this image this
 * way" — and because a bind group is the unit of binding: splitting them would
 * double the per-draw `setBindGroup` traffic for a pair that never varies
 * independently.
 *
 * They are a second group rather than two more bindings on group 0 because
 * group 0 is **per draw** and rebound at a dynamic offset for every object in
 * the frame, while this one is **per texture** and shared by every draw that
 * samples the same image. Merging them would mean one bind group per (draw ×
 * texture) instead of one per texture, allocated inside the frame — the cost
 * the dynamic-offset design exists to avoid.
 *
 * ## Fragment-only visibility
 *
 * Both entries are `FRAGMENT` alone. The vertex stage carries the uv through
 * as a varying and never samples, so declaring vertex visibility would ask the
 * implementation to reserve a vertex-stage texture slot for a resource no
 * vertex shader in this package reads (§62's per-stage binding limits are
 * where that shows up).
 *
 * `sampleType: "float"` and `type: "filtering"` are the pair that makes
 * `textureSample` legal: an `unfilterable-float` texture may only be sampled
 * with a `non-filtering` sampler, which is the trap a depth or float target
 * walks into (R-18's shadow map, WP-R1.6's targets) — those tiers declare
 * their own layout rather than widen this one.
 *
 * The same layout object is reused as the mip-generation blit's group 0
 * (`wgpu-texture.ts`): a blit binds exactly a texture and a sampler, so
 * declaring a second identical layout would be two objects for one shape.
