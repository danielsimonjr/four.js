/**
 * The unlit pipeline in hand-written WGSL (§64, §120's MVP tier), plus the
 * clear pipeline every view's clear is drawn with.
 *
 * This is the WGSL port of `gl-program.ts`'s `UnlitProgram`, and the port is
 * deliberately a *translation*: the same two matrices, the same flat colour,
 * the same optional per-vertex colour multiplier. RFC 0001's shader graph will
 * one day emit WGSL for this backend; hand-written WGSL is what makes that
 * emitter testable ("emit this pipeline and compare"), which is the argument
 * §7 of the R-1 plan settles at length.
 *
 * ## Two departures from the GLSL original, both forced by WebGPU
 *
 * ### 1. The depth remap lives here
 *
 * WebGL's clip space maps visible depth onto `z ∈ [-w, w]`; WebGPU's maps it
 * onto `z ∈ [0, w]`. `@four/math`'s projections are written to the WebGL
 * convention (D8), and they must stay that way: the math package may not learn
 * which backend is drawing (§3.1). So the remap
 *
 * ```wgsl
 * clip.z = (clip.z + clip.w) * 0.5
 * ```
 *
 * is applied **in this backend's vertex stage**, once, on the way out — the
 * placement the R-1 plan fixes (§3.3.8). It is exact, it costs one multiply-add
 * per vertex, and it keeps `Frustum`'s WebGL-convention plane extraction (which
 * `buildViewRenderList` culls with) correct for both backends, because the
 * matrix the CPU culls against is the un-remapped one.
 *
 * ### 2. `useMap` / `useVertexColors` are pipeline variants, not uniforms
 *
 * R-19 made them uniform branches on WebGL for a measured reason: a variant set
 * would have meant more programs compiled at initialization. That reason does
 * not survive the port. A `GPURenderPipeline` is immutable and combinatorial,
 * the cache that holds them is **lazy** (`wgpu-pipeline-cache.ts`), and a
 * variant nothing draws is never created at all — so the cost model inverts,
 * and the variant is strictly better: no per-fragment branch, and the vertex
 * layout can *omit* the colour buffer entirely rather than binding a dummy.
 *
 * `useMap` joined it in WP-R1.2, and joined it as a *variant* for the same
 * reason: the textured shader is compiled only for a frame that actually draws
 * a textured object, the untextured variants keep the one-bind-group pipeline
 * layout they had, and the uv stream is absent from the vertex layout rather
 * than bound as a dummy. The two flags multiply out to four variants, of which
 * a given application typically compiles one or two.

 * Separate buffers rather than one interleaved one, matching `gl-geometry.ts`:

 * stream is a straight upload with no CPU-side interleave pass.
 *
 * Slot index is *positional*, not fixed per stream — a textured, uncoloured
 * variant binds its uvs to slot 1, a textured and coloured one to slot 2 — so
 * the renderer's `setVertexBuffer` order has to be built in the same order this

/**

 * ## Why a *draw* clears, when WebGPU has `loadOp: "clear"`
 *
 * Because §61's clear contract is not "clear the surface", it is **"clear the
 * viewport rectangle"**: *"clears are confined to the viewport rectangle, never
 * the whole surface"*, which is what makes a minimap composite over the main
 * view rather than erase it. WebGPU's `loadOp` clears the whole attachment and
 * has no scissor, so a `loadOp: "clear"` implementation of a two-view frame
 * would erase the first view when the second began. `setScissorRect` plus a
 * full-surface triangle clears exactly the rectangle — which is what the WebGL
 * backend's scissored `clear` does, expressed in the primitives WebGPU has.
 *
 * The colour attachment therefore always loads (`loadOp: "load"`), and the
 * per-view rules fall out unchanged: a view carrying no `clearColor` draws no
 * clear triangle at all, and a view that carries one clears just its rectangle.
 * Depth is cleared for every view by the same draw — `depthCompare: "always"`
 * with `depthWriteEnabled: true` and `z = 1`, the far plane §61 names — so a
 * later view cannot be occluded by an earlier one's geometry.
 *
 * The colour-less variant writes no colour channels (`writeMask: 0`), so the
 * clear-depth-only case is the same draw with a different pipeline key rather
 * than a second code path.
