/**
 * The frame's lighting as **one uniform buffer** (§68, WP-R1.5), plus the
 * shared WGSL both shaded families splice in.
 *
 * This is the WebGPU port of the GL backend's light-set uploads — the five
 * `uniform3fv`/`uniform4fv` calls `PunctualLightUniforms` issues, the ambient
 * and directional uploads beside them, and `StandardProgram`'s eye position —
 * folded into a single block, written once per view and bound at
 * {@link LIGHTS_BIND_GROUP_INDEX} with a dynamic offset per view. That is the
 * "strictly simpler" the R-1 plan promised (§3.2): where GL uploads per
 * program per view, this backend packs one block per view into one buffer and
 * issues one `writeBuffer` for the whole frame.
 *
 * ## The layout, declared as data (§7 of the R-1 plan)
 *
 * Every slot is a **`vec4`**, deliberately: WGSL's `vec3<f32>` is 16-byte
 * aligned, so a `vec3` member or a tightly packed `array<vec3>` would leave
 * implicit padding the CPU packer has to know about anyway — a naive struct
 * silently misreads. All-`vec4` makes the byte layout below *total*: every
 * float of the block is named, none is implied.
 *
 * ```text
 * offset  member              contents
 *      0  ambientColor        rgb = SceneLights.ambientColor;      w = 0
 *     16  lightDirection      xyz = SceneLights.direction;         w = 0
 *     32  lightColor          rgb = SceneLights.directionalColor;  w = 0
 *     48  cameraPosition      xyz = the view's eye (§59);          w = 0
 *     64  counts              x = f32(punctualCount);        y, z, w = 0
 *     80  punctualPosition[8] xyz per light;                       w = 0
 *    208  punctualColor[8]    rgb premultiplied by intensity;      w = 0
 *    336  punctualDirection[8] xyz cone axis (§68);                w = 0
 *    464  punctualParams[8]   x range, y cos outer, z cone scale, w spot flag
 *    592  = LIGHT_UNIFORM_BYTES
 * ```
 *
 * Hemisphere rides the remaining spare stride after §69's shadow tail
 * (672…720 of 768). The first {@link LIGHT_UNIFORM_BYTES} bytes stay this
 * layout exactly — a no-hemisphere pack writes zeros in the new slots, so
 * every landed float in 0…592 is byte-identical. The unshadowed bind group
 * widens to {@link LIGHT_BINDING_BYTES} so the fragment can read the tail;
 * the shadowed twin does the same by growing
 * `SHADOW_LIGHT_UNIFORM_BYTES`.
 *
 * `counts.x` is an **`f32`, not a `u32`** — the block is packed through one
 * `Float32Array`, and a `u32` word inside it would need a second typed-array
 * view over the same bytes for one integer. `f32` is exact for every value the
 * count can take (0…`MAX_PUNCTUAL_LIGHTS`), and the shader reads it back
 * with `i32(lights.counts.x)`, which is exact over the same range.
 *
 * The four punctual arrays carry `SceneLights`' packed arrays **re-strided**
 * from three floats per light to four; `punctualParams` is `vec4` on both
 * sides and copies straight through. The scalar meanings are `lights.ts`'s,
 * verbatim — this module re-encodes, it never re-derives.
 *
 * ## One block for both families
 *
 * `cameraPosition` is only read by the standard family's specular lobe, and it
 * rides in the shared block anyway: it is per-view state exactly as the light
 * set is, and a second layout for one `vec4` would double the bind-group
 * plumbing to save 16 strided bytes that are already allocated. The lit WGSL
 * simply never reads the member — the same deal `DrawUniforms.color` has with
 * the clear pipeline's vertex stage.
 *
 * ## Where the groups sit
 *
 * `wgpu-bindings.ts` promised that a per-view group would arrive **as
 * group 1** without moving group 0 — this is that group. The unlit family's
 * `map` already owns group 1, so for the two shaded families the *same*
 * texture layout object binds at {@link SHADED_MAP_BIND_GROUP_INDEX} — a bind
 * group carries no index of its own (the pipeline layout assigns it), so the
 * texture cache's records serve both families unchanged.
 *
 * §59's packed metallic-roughness map reuses that same texture layout
 * object. WebGPU allows four bind groups, so the MR sample sits at
 * {@link SHADED_MR_BIND_GROUP_INDEX} **when albedo already occupies group 2**,
 * and at {@link SHADED_MAP_BIND_GROUP_INDEX} when there is no albedo (the
 * pipeline layout is then `[uniforms, lights, texture]` and group 3 would
 * be an empty slot the API does not permit). {@link shadedMrBindingWgsl}
 * takes the index so the two WGSL strings share one helper. The sampler
 * names (`mrTexture` / `mrSampler`) are distinct from the albedo pair so
 * both can coexist in the map+mr module.
 *
 * ## The shadow half rides the spare stride bytes (WP-R1.7)
 *
 * §69's comparison sampler is a structurally different binding, and it lives
 * in `wgpu-shadow.ts`: a **widened twin** of this block
 * (`SHADOW_LIGHT_UNIFORM_WGSL`) appends the shadow matrix and parameters in
 * the stride bytes this layout already leaves spare (592…672 of 768), and two
 * more bindings — `texture_depth_2d` and `sampler_comparison` — join it in a
 * second group-1 layout. This layout, this struct, and
 * {@link LIGHT_UNIFORM_BYTES} are untouched, which is what keeps every landed
 * shaded transcript byte-identical: a draw that receives no shadow still binds
 * exactly this block. The member list is shared as
 * {@link LIGHT_UNIFORM_MEMBERS_WGSL} so the two structs cannot drift.
