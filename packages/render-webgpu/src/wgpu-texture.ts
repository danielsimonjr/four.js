/**
 * GPU-side textures and samplers for the WebGPU backend: one `GPUTexture` per
 * `@four/render` `Texture`, cached and invalidated by version, plus a
 * **separate, deduplicated sampler cache** (§77, §83, §61).
 *
 * The port of `@four/render-webgl`'s `gl-texture.ts`, and deliberately so —
 * same key (`id`), same validator (`version`), same lazy eviction, same
 * loss-aware {@link WgpuTextureCache.forget}, same refusal to throw inside
 * `render`. Reading one module tells you how the other behaves. Everything
 * below is about the three places where WebGPU makes the port *not* a
 * transliteration.
 *
 * ## 1. A sampler is an object, so sampler state is deduplicated (§77)
 *
 * R-30 and R-30b made filter, wrap, mipmaps, min filter and anisotropy
 * upload-time state on the GL backend: five `texParameteri` calls written onto
 * the texture object, read by nothing on the draw path. WebGPU has no such
 * calls. The same five decisions become a `GPUSampler` — an immutable object,
 * bound beside the texture — and a thousand sprites sharing one atlas's filter
 * and wrap pair would otherwise allocate a thousand identical samplers.
 *
 * So this module keys samplers on a **canonical string of everything a sampler
 * bakes in**, exactly as `wgpu-pipeline-cache.ts` keys pipelines: address mode,
 * magnification filter, in-level minification filter, between-level filter, and
 * the resolved anisotropy. Two textures that name the same §77 state share one
 * sampler object; two that differ in any of the five get two. {@link samplerKey}
 * is exported so a test can assert the key rather than infer it from a hit.
 *
 * The key is built from the **resolved** values, not from the texture's raw
 * fields, which is what makes the deduplication real: a texture naming
 * `filter: "linear"` and one naming nothing at all resolve to the same five
 * values and therefore to the same sampler.
 *
 * ## 2. There is no `generateMipmap`, so the chain is drawn (§77, R-30b)
 *
 * WebGL 2 builds a mip chain with one call. WebGPU has no such entry point at
 * all — by design, because the filter a chain should be built with is a
 * decision the API declines to make for you. That leaves two honest tiers, and
 * this module picks the second:
 *
 * - **Degrade**: allocate one level and collapse a mip-choosing min filter to
 *   its in-level half, which is precisely what `gl-texture.ts` does for a
 *   *context* that cannot mipmap. Cheap, already precedented — and it would
 *   make this backend strictly worse than the WebGL one at a feature WebGPU
 *   supports perfectly well, which is the wrong trade for the backend §62 lists
 *   first. It would also make §84's accounting a lie in the other direction:
 *   `Texture.byteLength` bills the whole chain (R-30b), so a one-level
 *   allocation reports bytes it never allocated.
 * - **Generate**: allocate the chain and fill levels 1…n by **drawing** — a
 *   half-size blit per level, sampling the level above with a linear clamped
 *   sampler. That is what every WebGPU engine does, it is a box filter (the
 *   same filter `generateMipmap` is specified to be free to use), and it is
 *   what this module ships.
 *
 * The cost objection is answered the way `wgpu-pipeline-cache.ts` answers it:
 * **the generator is lazy**. The blit's WGSL module, its pipeline layout, its
 * sampler and its pipeline are created on the first upload that actually asks
 * for a chain, and are cached per texture format thereafter. An application
 * that mipmaps nothing compiles nothing, allocates nothing, and issues exactly
 * the command sequence it issued before this packet — the pipeline-cost law
 * (R-6) and the lazy-query law (R-30b) applied to a whole subsystem rather than
 * to one `getExtension`.
 *
 * A mipmapped texture that carries **no CPU data** skips generation entirely:
 * WebGPU zero-initializes every level, and filtering zeroes into zeroes is
 * `n - 1` render passes to compute what is already there.
 *
 * ## 3. An upload cannot disturb the frame
 *
 * `gl-texture.ts` ends every upload with `bindTexture(TEXTURE_2D, null)`, so an
 * upload triggered mid-frame cannot leave the wrong texture bound to unit 0.
 * There is nothing to undo here: `queue.writeTexture` names its destination and
 * binds nothing, and mip generation records into **its own command encoder**,
 * submitted before the frame's. WebGPU orders submissions, so the chain is
 * complete before the pass that samples it runs, and the frame's own encoder —
 * still recording — is untouched.
 *
 * ## Accounting (§83, §84)
 *
 * {@link WgpuTextureCache.byteLength} is the sum of the resident textures'
 * described bytes, computed level by level with the same loop
 * `Texture.byteLength` uses, so a cache holding one texture reports exactly
 * that texture's `byteLength` — 256 × 256 RGBA8 is 262 144 bytes, and 4 × 4
 * mipmapped is 84, on both backends. It is backend-side diagnostics, and it is
 * deliberately *not* wired into `@four/render`'s process-wide totals: those are
 * fed by `Texture` itself at construction and disposal (`resource-memory.ts`),
 * which is what keeps them true for a texture no renderer has met yet.
 *
 * ## Eviction policy
 *
 * Identical to `WgpuGeometryCache`'s and to the GL twin's, for identical
 * reasons: a **version bump** re-uploads on the next `acquire`, a
 * **`dispose()`d texture** is destroyed and then skipped (§83's "disposed
 * resources still in use"), and **device loss is not eviction** —
 * {@link WgpuTextureCache.forget} drops the records without destroying
 * allocations that belong to a device that is gone (§61).
