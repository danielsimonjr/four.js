/**
 * `readPixels`' mechanism: `copyTextureToBuffer` + `mapAsync` (WP-R1.6; §61,
 * §92, RFC 0005).
 *
 * This is the probe-verified path the R-1 plan names (§3.3.5), and it is the
 * evidence RFC 0005's asynchronous-forever commitment is right rather than
 * merely argued: WebGPU has **no synchronous readback at all** — a texture's
 * bytes reach the CPU only through a copy recorded on the queue and a map that
 * resolves when the GPU is done — so a `readPixels` that pretended to be
 * synchronous could not be implemented here honestly. §61's own sketch already
 * concedes the point (`readPixels?(…): Promise<ArrayBuffer>`), and
 * `WebgpuRenderer.readPixels` implements exactly that sketch. WP-R1.6 shipped
 * the whole-target form (shipping it rather than inventing a rectangle type
 * was the plan's explicit instruction); the `region` form arrived 2026-08-29
 * with `Rectangle2` in `@four/math` (RFC 0005's named prerequisite, cleared).
 * A region copies only its own rectangle — `copyTextureToBuffer`'s `origin` —
 * and rides the very same alignment, strip, and flip machinery: a region's
 * rows are simply shorter, so the repack below never distinguishes the cases.
 * A whole-target call records exactly the calls it recorded before the region
 * form existed (no `origin` member at all), which is what keeps WP-R1.6's
 * transcripts byte-identical.
 *
 * ## The 256-byte row (§62's alignment, owned here)
 *
 * `copyTextureToBuffer` requires `bytesPerRow` to be a multiple of 256
 * (WebGPU's `COPY_BYTES_PER_ROW_ALIGNMENT`), so a 100-texel-wide target's
 * 400-byte rows are copied 512 bytes apart and the buffer holds padding no
 * texel wrote. {@link readbackBytesPerRow} is that arithmetic, and the repack
 * below strips the padding while copying out of the mapped range — which has
 * to be copied regardless, because `unmap` detaches the `ArrayBuffer` the map
 * handed out.
 *
 * ## Row order: bottom-to-top, by decision
 *
 * §61's sketch says nothing about row order, so the first implementation gets
 * to fix it, and fixes it to **§7a's convention: row 0 of the result is the
 * bottom row of the image**, rows ascending upward. That is the order GL's
 * `readPixels` produces natively, so the byte layout is already the one the
 * WebGL backend will return when it lands the member — the cross-backend
 * agreement is decided here once instead of discovered as a flip later.
 * WebGPU's copy emits rows top-first (its framebuffer origin is top-left), so
 * the repack loop writes them in reverse; the flip rides the padding strip
 * this function performs anyway and costs no extra pass.

 *
 * `region` is measured in texels from the texture's **bottom-left** corner
 * (§7a, the space the result's rows are defined in) and must already be
 * validated against `width` × `height` — `validateReadbackRegion` in

 * runs it before calling here. The conversion to WebGPU's top-first `origin`
 * happens in exactly one place, below.
 *
 * Resolves `null` when the device surface does not carry the readback entry
 * points (`copyTextureToBuffer`, `mapAsync` — optional members whose presence
 * is the capability); the caller turns that into `UNSUPPORTED_GPU_FEATURE`.
 * The staging buffer is created per call and destroyed before resolving: a
 * readback is a diagnostic-tier operation (§92's visual tier, RFC 0005's
 * fallback path), and pooling a buffer that is mapped across an `await` would
 * trade a transient allocation for a reentrancy hazard.
