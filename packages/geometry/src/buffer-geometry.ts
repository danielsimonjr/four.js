/**
 * `BufferGeometry` (§53) — CPU-side vertex data, in the one shape the MVP
 * renderer draws.
 *
 * §53 describes a family (`Geometry2D`, `Geometry3D`, `IndexedGeometry`,
 * `ProceduralGeometry`, …) over an abstract base with `id`, `version`,
 * `bounds`, `computeBounds()`, `clone()`, and `dispose()`. This packet
 * implements exactly one concrete member of it — positions, the optional
 * per-vertex `normals`, `uvs`, `colors`, and (since RFC 0003) `joints`/`weights`
 * attributes, optional indices, a
 * draw mode — because that is what the §120 MVP renders (unlit, textured, and
 * Lambert-lit primitives, WebGL 2). The rest of the family and the rest of
 * §53's standard attribute set (tangents, a secondary uv set,
 * instance transforms) are deliberately absent rather than
 * sketched: each of them pins a public layout that the WebGL backend and the
 * §79 scene format both have to agree with, and none of them is needed to draw
 * a textured box.
 *
 * `normals` joined the layout with the §68 lighting packet (2026-08-04): a lit
 * surface (§120 "lighting") cannot be shaded without per-vertex normals, and
 * §53's own attribute list names them first. The attribute is **optional** —
 * 2D shapes stay position-only and unlit — and, when present, index-aligned
 * with `positions`: `normals[3 * i]` is vertex `i`'s normal x. Unit length is
 * the author's contract, not validated here (§85 checks finiteness only; the
 * lit pipeline normalizes after interpolation anyway, and re-checking length
 * per component would reject legitimately denormalized authored data).
 *
 * `uvs` and `colors` joined it the same way (R-19), and follow the `normals`
 * precedent exactly — optional, index-aligned, §85-validated on assignment,
 * dropped by `dispose()`:
 *
 * - **`uvs`** are 2 floats per vertex (`uvs[2 * i]` is vertex `i`'s u), the
 *   texture coordinate §53 names and §55/§57's `map` samples with. `v = 0` is
 *   the bottom edge, matching §7a's Y-up world and the bottom-row-first texel
 *   order `@four/render`'s `TextureSource` documents — so a textured quad needs
 *   no flip anywhere. Values outside 0…1 are legal (they tile or clamp
 *   according to the sampler, which is backend state, not geometry state).
 * - **`colors`** are 4 floats per vertex (`colors[4 * i]` is vertex `i`'s red),
 *   straight (non-premultiplied) RGBA in the same nominal 0…1 range and with
 *   the same "no color space attached" policy `UnlitMaterial.color` states
 *   (§60a). They are what makes §113's debug-draw overlay drawable: a segment
 *   list is positions plus colors, uploaded once and drawn with
 *   `UnlitMaterial({ vertexColors: true })`.
 *
 * Neither is *consumed* unless a material asks for it: a geometry may carry uvs
 * and still draw flat-coloured, which is what keeps the attributes free to add
 * to the primitive builders without changing a single existing pixel.
 *
 * `joints` and `weights` joined on 2026-08-28 (§54; RFC 0003 — this is "the
 * act of pinning that layout" the paragraph above deferred), following the
 * same precedent — optional, index-aligned, §85-validated on assignment,
 * dropped by `dispose()`:
 *
 * - **`joints`** are **4 joint indices per vertex** (`joints[4 * i]` is vertex
 *   `i`'s first influence), as a `Uint16Array`. This package cannot name a
 *   bone — its §3.1 row is `core, math` — so a joint is an *index*, and what
 *   it indexes is somebody else's problem: `@four/scene`'s `Skeleton.bones`,
 *   whose insertion order is the ABI (§33). Indices are **not** range-checked
 *   here, because the geometry cannot see the skeleton; the backend's joint
 *   limit and the skeleton's own length are checked where each is known.
 * - **`weights`** are 4 floats per vertex, index-parallel with `joints`.
 *   Their sum per vertex should be 1, and — the `normals` precedent applied
 *   verbatim — that is the author's contract, not validated here: §85 checks
 *   finiteness only, and a renormalization would silently rewrite authored
 *   data.
 *
 * Four influences per vertex matches glTF's `JOINTS_0`/`WEIGHTS_0` and fixes
 * the attribute budget; a second set (`JOINTS_1`/`WEIGHTS_1`) is the named
 * extension point, at the next two locations, so the layout is not
 * re-litigated (RFC 0003 open question 2, adopted). The WebGL backend binds
 * these at the fixed attribute locations **4 (joints)** and **5 (weights)**,
 * continuing R-19's numbering — 0 position, 1 normal, 2 uv, 3 colour.
 *
 * ## Version, not events
 *
 * Backends cache GPU buffers per geometry. The cache key is
 * {@link BufferGeometry.version}, which advances on every mutation the geometry
 * can see — the same contract `Transform.version` (§7) offers, down to the
 * rule for mutations it *cannot* see:
 *
 * ```ts
 * geometry.positions[0] = 2;  // in-place edit — invisible to the geometry
 * geometry.uvs![0] = 0.5;     // …and so is one into any other attribute
 * geometry.markDirty();       // announce it: version += 1
 * ```
 *
 * Replacing an array wholesale (`geometry.positions = next`) goes through a
 * setter which validates and bumps the version for you. There is no change
 * event: a renderer that draws a geometry every frame compares a number, and an
 * event would cost a subscription per geometry per backend for no extra
 * information.
 *
 * ## Validation (§85)
 *
 * §85 requires development builds to detect "NaN and infinite values" and
 * "invalid geometry indices". Both are checked **when an array is assigned** —
 * at construction or through a setter — and never per frame: assignment is an
 * authoring-time event, so an O(n) pass there is free, while the same pass on
 * the draw path would be the most expensive thing the renderer does. Failures
 * throw `RangeError`/`TypeError` rather than `FourError`: §89's code union has
 * no argument-validation member today, and extending it belongs to the packet
 * that owns `@four/core` (reported as a WP-3.3 decision).
 *
 * In-place edits followed by {@link BufferGeometry.markDirty} are *not*
 * re-validated. That is the fast path, and re-validating it would defeat the
 * purpose of having one.
 *
 * ## Resource accounting (§83, A-5)
 *
 * Every geometry reports its size ({@link BufferGeometry.byteLength}) to the
 * process-wide totals in `resource-memory.ts` — at construction, on each
 * attribute replacement, and on `dispose()` — which is what makes §84's
 * `bufferMemory` measurable and a leaked geometry visible. The accounting is
 * arithmetic on two module-level numbers, holds no reference to anything, and
 * never runs on a draw path. `resource-memory.ts` documents the design.

   * reference* and the documented way to edit them is an in-place write
   * followed by {@link BufferGeometry.markDirty}. A shallow clone would
   * therefore give two geometries one buffer and two independent version
   * counters — an in-place edit through either handle would silently change
   * what the other draws while leaving the other's version (and so every
   * backend cache keyed on it) untouched. That is not a cheaper clone; it is a
   * cache-coherence bug with a convenient name.
   *
   * There is nothing else in a geometry to copy: the bounds are derived (the
   * clone recomputes them on first use, to the same values), the id is
   * deliberately not copied, and the geometry holds no references to nodes,
   * materials, or backends.
   *
   * The cost is honest and worth stating: `clone()` allocates and copies
   * `byteLength` bytes, and reports them to the §83 totals as a second live
   * geometry. Cloning is for *forking* data — a procedural mesh about to be
   * deformed per instance. Sharing one geometry between many renderables needs
   * no clone at all (§83: geometries are shared, not owned by nodes).
   *
   * @throws TypeError if this geometry has been disposed. A disposed geometry
   * holds no data, so the copy would be a silently empty mesh — §83 names
   * "disposed resources still in use" as a thing to *detect*, and a refusal at
   * the call site is the earliest place to detect it.
