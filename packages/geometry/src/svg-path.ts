/**
 * §50's *"SVG import/export compatibility"*, at the **path-data tier**: the
 * `d` attribute in, a `d` attribute out, over §51's {@link Path}.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const path = parseSvgPathData("M 0 0 L 100 0 A 50 50 0 0 1 0 0 Z");
 * formatSvgPathData(path.subdivide(2));
 * ```
 *
 * Placement is §98's, and it is the same sentence that placed §51: *"`geometry`:
 * 2D and 3D geometry, **path model**, tessellation module (§52)"*. The `d`
 * attribute is not a rendering concern and not an asset concern — it is the
 * *serialized form of the path model*, so it belongs beside the model.
 * `render-svg` (§62) is a **backend** that draws a whole scene into SVG markup;
 * `@four/assets` (§76) owns SVG as a *file* to fetch and cache. Neither of them
 * is this, and this needs neither of them.
 *
 * ## What ships here, and what is staged
 *
 * §50 asks for SVG *compatibility* from a shape system. That system does not
 * exist yet (gap `R-23`: none of §50's fourteen shape nodes is built, and §58's
 * paints — gap `R-16` — are not either). What *does* exist is the geometry all
 * fourteen reduce to, so what ships is the geometry half, complete:
 *
 * | tier                                                | state | owner                                     |
 * | --------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
 * | `d` attribute → {@link Path}                          | ships | here                                      |
 * | {@link Path} → `d` attribute                          | ships | here                                      |
 * | `<svg>` document, `viewBox`, `transform`, `<g>`       | staged | needs an XML reader (see below)          |
 * | `<rect>`/`<circle>`/`<ellipse>`/`<line>`/`<polyline>`/`<polygon>` | staged | `R-23` — each *is* one of §50's shape nodes, and building a second, attribute-shaped spelling of them here would be inventing the shape system twice |
 * | `fill`, `stroke`, `stroke-width`, dashes, joins, caps | staged | `R-16` — §58's paint model; a parser that read them would have nowhere to put them |
 * | `fill-rule` (a presentation attribute, not path data) | staged | `R-16`; {@link Path.fillRule} is the field it lands in, and it is settable today |
 *
 * The document tier is staged on a **decision**, not on effort: parsing
 * `<svg>` markup needs an XML reader, and the only one every environment has is
 * `DOMParser`, which exists in browsers and not in Node. `@four/geometry` is
 * verified node-safe (`pnpm graph:check`), and this repository's rule for a
 * capability that only one environment has is an injected seam, not a global
 * reference — the shape it would take is the `FetchLike` pattern in
 * `@four/assets`. That is one packet, with an owner decision in it (ship a
 * ~2 kB tokenizer, or require the host to hand over a parsed document), and it
 * is honest to name it rather than to half-build it. Everything below is pure
 * string arithmetic and runs identically in both environments.
 *
 * ## The Y axis: this module **transcribes**, it does not flip (§7a)
 *
 * SVG user space has +Y **down**. four.js world space has +Y **up**, in 2D as
 * well as 3D (§7a). {@link parseSvgPathData} does **not** reconcile them: the
 * numbers in the `d` attribute are the numbers in the {@link Path}, so content
 * imported and drawn without further thought appears **mirrored about the X
 * axis**. That is a decision, and these are the reasons:
 *
 * 1. **A flip alone is the wrong transform anyway.** SVG's origin is the
 *    top-left of the viewport, so content lives at `y ∈ [0, height]`; negating
 *    `y` puts it at `[-height, 0]`, which is not where anyone wants it either.
 *    The transform that actually lands SVG content in a Y-up world is
 *    `y ↦ height − y`, and `height` comes from the `viewBox` — which is in the
 *    **document**, not in the `d` attribute. A `d` parser that flipped would be
 *    performing exactly half of a transform it cannot complete, silently. Half
 *    a correction is worse than none, because none is visible.
 * 2. **Transcription is a checkable contract.** "Every number in, the same
 *    number out" is what makes `format(parse(d))` a testable identity and what
 *    makes §50's word *compatibility* mean something. A flipping parser would
 *    have to flip the arc sweep flags too, and the correctness of the flip
 *    would become part of the correctness of the parser.
 * 3. **The correction is one exact line, at the caller, where the `viewBox`
 *    is.** Negation is exact in IEEE-754 and {@link Path.transform} accepts a
 *    reflection (including for arcs — a reflection is a similarity):
 *
 *    ```ts
 *    // column-major: x ↦ x, y ↦ height − y
 *    const svgToWorld = new Matrix3().fromArray([1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, height, 1]);
 *    const world = parseSvgPathData(d).transform(svgToWorld);
 *    ```
 *
 *    The document tier above is the packet that will apply it for you, because
 *    it is the tier that knows `height`.
 *
 * {@link formatSvgPathData} is the mirror image of that decision, and therefore
 * consistent with it: it writes the path's own numbers, so a path authored in a
 * Y-up world round-trips exactly and *renders* mirrored in an SVG viewer unless
 * the caller applies the inverse transform first. One convention, stated once,
 * applied in both directions.
 *
 * ## Arcs: endpoint in, endpoint out, centre in the middle
 *
 * SVG's `A` command is **endpoint-parameterized** (`rx ry rotation large-arc
 * sweep x y`); §51's `PathArcCommand` is **centre-parameterized** with a signed
 * sweep. The conversion each way is the one in SVG 1.1 Appendix F.6, and it is
 * where the interesting caveats live:
 *
 * - **The conversion is transcendental in both directions** (`atan2`, `sqrt`,
 *   `cos`, `sin`), so an imported arc is §33 **same-runtime**, exactly like
 *   every other arc operation in §51. Lines and Béziers are exact both ways —
 *   see "Determinism" below.
 * - **The round trip is shape-preserving, not bit-preserving, for arcs.**
 *   `parse → format → parse` reproduces the same ellipse to within a few ulps,
 *   and reproduces the flags and the rotation exactly, but it is not an
 *   identity on the command list. For paths of `M`/`L`/`Q`/`C`/`Z` it *is* an
 *   identity, exactly.
 * - **The rotation changes units.** SVG's `x-axis-rotation` is in **degrees**;
 *   §7b says every engine angle is radians. `deg → rad → deg` is two roundings,
 *   which is the second reason arcs do not round-trip bit-exactly.
 * - **A full turn cannot be one `A`.** An arc of `|Δ| = 2π` has coincident
 *   endpoints, and SVG's F.6.2 says an `A` with coincident endpoints draws
 *   *nothing*. {@link formatSvgPathData} therefore writes such an arc as two
 *   `A` commands of half the sweep each — the only splitting it ever does.
 * - **An arc carries an implicit line.** §51's arc starts at its own first
 *   point and contributes a straight segment from the current point when the
 *   two differ (the Canvas rule). SVG has no such rule, so the writer emits
 *   that segment as an explicit `L`. It is what makes a rounded rectangle —
 *   four `arc` calls and no `lineTo` at all — export correctly.
 *
 * ## The arc's start is authoritative, and the reader is one command behind
 *
 * That last bullet has a sharp edge on the *import* side, and it is the one
 * design decision here that changes a number the document wrote.
 *
 * SVG's `A` **begins at the current point** — that is what "endpoint
 * parameterization" means. §51's arc begins wherever
 * `centre + R(rotation)·(rx cos θ₁, ry sin θ₁)` lands, and no choice of centre
 * makes that expression hit an arbitrary point exactly: deriving the centre
 * from the desired start reproduces it exactly for only ~83% of arcs (measured
 * over 200 000 random ones), because `(a − b) + b` is not an identity in binary
 * floating point.
 *
 * So after `L 0 12 A 12 12 0 0 1 12 0` the line ends at `(0, 12)` and the arc
 * starts at `(0, 12.000000000000002)`. §51 dutifully inserts its implicit
 * connecting segment: two ulps long, pointing *back up* the line that just
 * arrived. In the flattening that is a zero-area spike, and §52's tessellator
 * refuses it — correctly, and with a precise message. The shape that hits this
 * is `L … A …` repeated four times: **the rounded rectangle**, which is the
 * most common non-trivial thing in any SVG file. An importer that cannot fill a
 * rounded rectangle is not an importer.
 *
 * The fix is to decide which of the two points is authoritative, and it is the
 * arc's — because the document's claim is *"the arc starts where you are"*, and
 * the only way to make that claim exactly true in this model is to move where
 * you are. {@link parseSvgPathData} therefore holds each line, quadratic and
 * cubic back by one command; if an arc follows, the held segment's **endpoint**
 * is retargeted to the arc's computed start before it is appended. The move is
 * a few ulps — strictly smaller than the error the endpoint→centre conversion
 * has already introduced — and it is the only place in this module where an
 * output coordinate is not exactly what the document said. If anything other
 * than an arc follows, the segment is written exactly as the document wrote it.
 *
 * The residual, stated rather than hidden: **arc → arc** seams still carry the
 * implicit segment, because the second arc's start is computed from its own
 * conversion and nothing precedes it that could be retargeted. Those seams are
 * tangentially continuous (both arcs pass through the same document point from
 * the same direction), so the micro-segment does not double back, and no case
 * in the test corpus — including the two-arc circle every SVG writer emits —
 * has produced a §52 refusal.
 *
 * ## Coverage of the `d` grammar: complete
 *
 * All ten commands, both cases, plus every syntactic wrinkle the grammar
 * actually has: implicit repetition of an argument set, implicit `lineto` after
 * a `moveto`, optional separators (`1-2` is two numbers), a single optional
 * comma between numbers, the greedy number scan that reads `1.5.5` as two
 * numbers, and flags written without separators (`a1 1 0 011 1`). `B`/`b`
 * (bearing) appeared in an SVG 2 draft, was removed before Candidate
 * Recommendation, and is refused.
 *
 * ## Refusals, and the one place a format rule outranks §85
 *
 * §85's house rule is refuse loudly rather than rewrite silently, and every
 * malformed input below throws a `SyntaxError` naming the offset. But a handful
 * of inputs that *look* like §85 clamps are nothing of the kind: SVG 1.1
 * F.6.6 **defines** what a conforming reader does with an out-of-range arc
 * radius, and a reader that refused them could not read valid documents — which
 * is the entire point of §50's requirement. **A format conformance rule is not
 * a clamp**; it is what the document means. The line between the two is drawn
 * exactly here:
 *
 * | input                              | what happens                       | why |
 * | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --- |
 * | negative `rx`/`ry`                 | absolute value taken               | F.6.6.1 — defined |
 * | `rx` or `ry` of zero               | becomes a straight `L` to the endpoint | F.6.6.1 — defined |
 * | arc endpoints coincident           | the arc is omitted                 | F.6.2 — defined |
 * | radii too small to span the chord  | scaled up uniformly by `√Λ`        | F.6.6.2/3 — defined |
 * | a second `Z` with nothing open     | no-op                              | unambiguous; nothing is dropped or guessed |
 * | an arc whose chord is unresolvable beside its radii in double precision | becomes a straight `L` | the arc *is* its chord at that scale; see `appendArc` |
 * | a segment immediately followed by an arc | its endpoint moves onto the arc's start, by a few ulps | the document says the arc begins there; see the section above |
 * | a flag that is not `0` or `1`      | **refused**                        | the grammar admits nothing else |
 * | a number the grammar does not admit | **refused**                       | |
 * | a numeric literal denoting `±∞`    | **refused**                        | §85: no non-finite coordinate |
 * | an arc whose centre parameterization overflows | **refused**            | §85 |
 * | any command letter outside the ten | **refused**                        | |
 * | path data not starting with `M`/`m` | **refused**                       | the grammar requires it |
 * | anything after the first error     | **refused** — nothing is kept      | see below |
 *
 * The last row is a deliberate divergence from SVG's own error handling, which
 * says a viewer renders the path *up to* the error. That rule exists so a
 * browser shows something; it is the wrong rule for an importer, because it
 * turns a typo into silently missing geometry. §85 wins: an unparseable `d`
 * yields no path at all.
 *
 * ## Hostile input (§96)
 *
 * A `d` attribute is untrusted text — it arrives from a file, a network
 * response, or a user paste. Three properties, each of them checked rather than
 * asserted (`tests/…/svg-path.test.ts` fuzzes ~30 000 hostile strings):
 *
 * - **No regular expressions anywhere.** The scanner compares character codes
 *   in a single forward pass. There is no backtracking, so there is no
 *   catastrophic backtracking: the parser is O(n) in the input length on
 *   *every* input, not merely on well-formed ones.
 * - **Total.** Every input either yields a {@link Path} or throws — a
 *   `SyntaxError` for text the grammar rejects, a `RangeError` for a caller's
 *   own bad option, or a `FourError` (`UNTRUSTED_INPUT_REJECTED`) for the size
 *   limit. It never hangs and never returns a half-built path: every branch of
 *   the scanner either consumes at least one character or throws, which is what
 *   makes termination structural rather than hoped for.
 * - **Bounded, with one limit rather than several.**
 *   {@link SvgPathParseOptions.maximumTextLength} is the only bound, and one is
 *   enough *because* of the property above: the parser recurses nowhere, works
 *   in O(1) per character, and allocates linearly in the input, so bounding the
 *   text bounds the time, the stack, and the heap together. A second limit on
 *   the command count would be a number with no independent meaning.
 *
 * Nothing here evaluates anything: no `eval`, no `Function`, no dynamic import
 * — §96's *"no arbitrary code execution from scene files"* holds trivially, and
 * the CSP suite (`tests/integration/security-csp.test.ts`) is what keeps it
 * true.
 *
 * ## Determinism (§33): two tiers, the §51 split, inherited
 *
 * `R-24` established that a tier is a property of the *operation*, not the
 * module, and that survives here unchanged:
 *
 * | operation                                    | tier           | why |
 * | -------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --- |
 * | parsing `M`/`L`/`H`/`V`/`Q`/`T`/`C`/`S`/`Z`  | cross-platform | ECMA-262 specifies decimal-string → double exactly, and relative coordinates are one `+` |
 * | parsing `A`                                  | same-runtime   | `cos`, `sin`, `sqrt`, `atan2` |
 * | writing `M`/`L`/`Q`/`C`/`Z`                  | cross-platform | ECMA-262 specifies `Number::toString` exactly |
 * | writing `A`                                  | same-runtime   | the arc's endpoints are `centre + r·(cos θ, sin θ)` |
 *
 * `tests/determinism/svg-path.test.ts` pins those two tiers **separately**,
 * with the two digests and two `_tier` labels `golden/path.json` established,
 * for the same reason: averaging them would let a transcendental introduced
 * into the Bézier path hide inside the arc half's weaker claim.
 *
 * The cross-platform claim has exactly one documented edge, and it is
 * ECMA-262's, not this module's: a decimal literal with **more than 20
 * significant digits** may legally be rounded to either of the two nearest
 * doubles, so `M 0.10000000000000000000005 0` is the one shape of input on
 * which two conforming engines may disagree. Authored SVG does not contain such
 * literals — writers emit far fewer digits, and this module's own writer emits
 * the *shortest* string that round-trips (never more than 17 significant
 * digits, and 17 is inside the exact range).
 *
 * ## The number format, and why it is `String(value)`
 *
 * The writer's numeric format is a determinism decision, so it is stated: every
 * number is written with `String(value)`, JavaScript's shortest decimal string
 * that round-trips to the same double. It is the right choice on both axes at
 * once — ECMA-262 specifies `Number::toString` **exactly** (so two conforming
 * engines write the same bytes, a `cross-platform` claim), and it is
 * **lossless** (so `parse(format(p))` recovers `p`'s coordinates bit for bit).
 * A fixed-decimal format would have been neither. A *lossy* writer — round to
 * three decimals to halve the bytes — is a real thing to want and a real policy
 * decision; it is deliberately not an option here, because a `d` attribute that
 * silently loses precision is exactly the kind of quiet rewrite §85 exists to
 * prevent, and the packet that adds it should also decide what it does to a
 * golden.
 *
 * Output shape: absolute uppercase commands only, single ASCII spaces, no
 * commas, no implicit repetition, no leading or trailing space. It is not the
 * shortest possible `d` string and does not try to be — a compactor is a
 * separate, lossless, and independently testable transformation.

/**
 * Writes a §51 {@link Path} as an SVG `d` attribute (§50 "SVG export").
 *
 * ```ts
 * formatSvgPathData(new Path().moveTo(0, 0).lineTo(10, 0).close());
 * // "M 0 0 L 10 0 Z"
 * ```
 *
 * Absolute uppercase commands, single spaces, no commas, and every number as
 * `String(value)` — lossless and, unlike a fixed-decimal format, exactly
 * specified by ECMA-262. The module header states the whole policy and why a
 * lossy option is deliberately absent.
 *
 * Coordinates are written **verbatim**, so the output is in the path's own
 * space: a path authored in §7a's Y-up world renders mirrored in an SVG viewer
 * unless the caller flips it first. That is the same decision
 * {@link parseSvgPathData} makes, in the other direction.
 *
 * Round trip: for a path of moves, lines, quadratics, cubics and closes,
 * `parseSvgPathData(formatSvgPathData(path))` reproduces the command list bit
 * for bit. For a path containing arcs it reproduces the *shape* to within a few
 * ulps — SVG stores an arc by its endpoints and its rotation in degrees, and
 * neither conversion is exact.
 *
 * @param path any path, including an empty one (which yields `""`)
 * @returns the `d` attribute's value, with no leading or trailing space
