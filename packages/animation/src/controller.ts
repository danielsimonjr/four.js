/**
 * §18 animation state machines — {@link AnimationController}.
 *
 * §18 asks for a *declarative* controller that owns states and transitions
 * instead of an application `if`-chain swapping mixers:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const controller = new AnimationController({
 *   target: character,
 *   states: { idle: idleClip, walk: walkClip, run: runClip },
 *   parameters: { numbers: { speed: 0 } },
 *   transitions: [
 *     { from: "idle", to: "walk", when: [{ parameter: "speed", is: "greater", value: 0.1 }], duration: 0.2 },
 *     { from: "walk", to: "run",  when: [{ parameter: "speed", is: "greater", value: 5 }],   duration: 0.3 },
 *   ],
 * }).play();
 *
 * animation.track(controller);          // §39 step 3, exactly like a mixer
 * controller.setNumber("speed", 6);     // the machine takes it from here
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why this is not an `AnimationMixer` with a state field
 *
 * An {@link ./mixer.js#AnimationMixer} plays **one** clip and *claims* the
 * properties it writes: two mixers on one property resolve last-started-wins
 * with a §16 warning, which is a conflict, not a blend. §18's central feature —
 * `duration` on a transition — needs two clips contributing to one property at
 * once, so the controller cannot be a layer that starts and stops mixers. It is
 * a **pose evaluator in its own right**: it resolves one binding per animated
 * property (a *channel*), samples the source and destination clips into scratch,
 * mixes them through the channel's {@link ./values.js#ValueAdapter}, and writes
 * the result once. One claim per channel, held for the controller's whole life,
 * so a controller and a tween still resolve by §16's one rule.
 *
 * ## Channels, and what a state that does not animate one does
 *
 * A channel is the union of every state clip's track paths, in declaration order
 * (states in `states` order, tracks in `clip.tracks` order); the first
 * occurrence fixes the channel index, and every later track on that path must
 * agree on {@link ./values.js#ValueKind} — blending a `vector3` against a
 * `number` has no meaning, so it is a construction error rather than a runtime
 * surprise.
 *
 * A state that has no track for a channel contributes the channel's
 * **baseline**: the value the property held when {@link AnimationController.play}
 * captured it. That is a deliberate choice over "leave the property alone":
 *
 * - the written pose is then a pure function of (state, state time, weight) —
 *   the determinism argument this file rests on (§33) — instead of a function of
 *   whatever wrote the property last;
 * - a cross-fade into a state that animates a channel the source does not fades
 *   *from the baseline* instead of snapping, and out of one fades back to it.
 *
 * The consequence is worth stating plainly: a controller pins every channel it
 * owns, so a property animated by only one of five states is held at its
 * baseline while the other four play.
 *
 * ## Transition semantics (§18)
 *
 * | §18 feature              | how it is expressed here |
 * | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
 * | parameters               | declared up front in three kinds — numbers, Booleans, triggers ({@link AnimationControllerParameters}) |
 * | Boolean conditions       | `{ parameter, is: "true" \| "false" }` |
 * | numeric comparisons      | `{ parameter, is: "greater" \| … , value }` |
 * | triggers                 | `{ parameter, is: "triggered" }`, latched until a transition consumes them |
 * | transition duration      | `duration` seconds of cross-fade (§7a: seconds, never a normalized fraction) |
 * | exit time                | `exitTime` seconds of source-state time that must have elapsed |
 * | transition interruption  | `interruptible` (default `true`) — see below |
 * | blend trees              | a state may be a {@link ./blend-tree.js#BlendTree} |
 * | layered animation        | {@link ./layer-stack.js#AnimationLayerStack} |
 * | "any state" transitions  | `from: "*"` (see below) |
 * | clip events              | {@link AnimationController.onClipEvent} |
 * | `when` string sugar      | compiles to the typed records below |
 *
 * **Conditions are typed predicates.** §18's sketch writes `when: "speed > 0.1"`.
 * The structured form is the evaluation target — an undeclared parameter or a
 * Boolean compared with `>` throws at construction, not never. The optional
 * string form is sugar with a *restricted* grammar (parameter, operator, number
 * or `true`/`false`; a bare identifier is a Boolean/`trigger` test) that
 * compiles to the same records and throws on parse failure.
 *
 * **A transition is taken when all of its conditions hold.** `when` is an AND;
 * an absent or empty `when` is vacuously true, which is what makes
 * `{ from: "attack", to: "idle", exitTime: 0.8 }` an automatic sequence. The
 * candidates are scanned in **declaration order** and the first eligible one
 * fires, so precedence is the order the author wrote (§33: insertion order
 * only).
 *
 * **Exit time is a gate in seconds.** `exitTime` is compared against the source
 * state's elapsed time, so the transition is ineligible until the state has
 * played that long. §7a forbids the normalized 0–1 fraction other engines use;
 * write `exitTime: clip.duration * 0.8` if a fraction is what you mean.
 *
 * **Interruption freezes the outgoing pose by default.** While a transition
 * runs, the machine evaluates the transitions leaving its *destination* state —
 * that state is what the controller reports as
 * {@link AnimationController.currentState} — unless the running transition
 * declared `interruptible: false`, in which case nothing is evaluated until it
 * completes. When a transition *is* interrupted, the blended pose at that
 * instant is captured per channel and becomes the frozen source of the new
 * transition. {@link AnimationControllerOptions.liveInterrupt} keeps sampling
 * the previous source and destination plus the new destination (three clips)
 * for a *single* interruption depth; a second interrupt falls back to freeze
 * so the chain stays bounded.
 *
 * **`from: "*"` is any state.** Wildcard transitions are scanned in declaration
 * order with the rest. A wildcard is eligible from every state except when
 * `from`/`to` would be a self-transition, unless the edge declared
 * `allowSelf: true`.
 *
 * ## Determinism (§33, §16)
 *
 * The controller reads no clock and no RNG: time enters only through
 * {@link AnimationController.advance}, exactly as a mixer's does, and the
 * `AnimationSystem` feeds it the fixed delta. Every ordered walk is over an
 * array — channels in construction order, transitions in declaration order — and
 * the three parameter `Map`s are only ever *looked up*, never iterated, so no
 * observable behaviour can depend on a `Map`'s iteration order. Given the same
 * initial state, the same parameter writes, and the same sequence of deltas, the
 * same values are written in the same order.
 *
 * What a controller deliberately does **not** have is
 * {@link ./mixer.js#AnimationMixer.seek}: a state machine's pose is a function
 * of its *history* (which conditions held when), not of a single time axis, so
 * there is no time to scrub to. Replay (§34) reproduces a controller by
 * replaying the deltas and the parameter writes, which is what §34 already does
 * for the rest of the engine.
 *
 * ## Allocation (§7b)
 *
 * {@link AnimationController.play} allocates: per channel one binding, one
 * claim, and the scratches a pose evaluation needs (baselines, frozen source,
 * per-state samples, blend-tree clip samples, live-interrupt mid, blend). After
 * that the advance path allocates nothing — sampling writes through the
 * scratches and blending writes through the blend scratch.
 *
 * ## Staged remainder (PH-9, 2026-09-06)
 *
 * Shipped here: blend trees (1D lerp + 2D inverse-distance of ≤3 neighbours),
 * `from: "*"` any-state transitions, clip-event dispatch with mixer `(from, to]`
 * semantics, `when` string sugar, and `liveInterrupt` at one interruption depth.
 * Layered / additive animation lives on {@link ./layer-stack.js#AnimationLayerStack}.
 *
 * Still **not** shipped:
 *
 * - **Serialization.** §18 constructs a controller directly and §97a lists
 *   `Node.animation` among the names with no shipped equivalent, so a controller
 *   is not a §6a component and has no §79 node-data serializer. Making it one is
 *   a separate decision with its own registry entry.
 * - **Unbounded live-interrupt chains.** A second interrupt still freezes.
