/**
 * Animation tracks (§17).
 *
 * A track is a **typed keyframe sequence over clip-local time** (§9: animation
 * time is clip-local and lives on players and clips, never in the global
 * `TimeState`). It is pure data plus one pure function:
 * {@link AnimationTrack.sample} maps a time in seconds to a value, and the same
 * time always yields the same value (§16 "value tracks are a pure function of
 * timeline time", §33 determinism).
 *
 * ## Tracks hold no binding
 *
 * A track carries a **property path string** and nothing else about its target.
 * Resolving that path to a live property is the mixer's job (WP-4.6), done once
 * per target through `createBinding` (§16: "string-path convenience forms are
 * resolved once, at creation time"). Keeping the binding out of the track is
 * what lets one clip drive many targets, be serialized, and be compared for
 * equality without dragging a scene graph along.
 *
 * ## Track types (§17)
 *
 * §17 lists scalar, vector, quaternion, color, Boolean, discrete, morph weight,
 * skeletal joint, and custom property. The first six and the last are covered
 * here by supplying the matching {@link ValueAdapter} from `./values.js`:
 *
 * | §17 track type    | adapter                                     |
 * | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
 * | scalar            | `numberAdapter`                             |
 * | vector            | `vector2Adapter` / `vector3Adapter` / `vector4Adapter` |
 * | quaternion        | `quaternionAdapter` (slerp — see below)     |
 * | color             | `colorAdapter` (RGBA 4-tuple, plan P4-2)    |
 * | Boolean           | `booleanAdapter`                            |
 * | discrete          | `discreteAdapterFor<T>()`                   |
 * | custom property   | any caller-supplied `ValueAdapter<T>`       |
 *
 * The track takes the adapter directly rather than a second track-type
 * discriminant: {@link ValueAdapter.kind} already *is* that discriminant, and a
 * parallel enum would only have to be kept in sync with it.
 *
 * **Morph-weight and skeletal-joint tracks are binding forms, not track
 * types** — §17's list is 9 of 9 as of RFC 0003 (2026-08-28), and this
 * paragraph corrects the staged note that used to stand here (P4-3 promised
 * the two would "add their kinds to `ValueKind`"; read against the shipped
 * design, that is not what they need, and §17's amendment records why —
 * duplicate discriminants for values the adapters already represent). A
 * *skeletal joint* track animates a bone's translation/rotation/scale: those
 * are `vector3` and `quaternion` values, the `quaternionAdapter` already
 * slerps (§17's fifth interpolation entry), and a bone is addressed through
 * `Skeleton.bones` — `"bones.3.transform.rotation"`, insertion order being
 * the ABI (§33). A *morph weight* track animates a `number` into one element
 * of the `MorphWeights` component's array — `"weights.0"`. Both resolve
 * through the indexed-array binding form `./binding.js` documents; no new
 * `ValueKind`, adapter, or track type exists.
 *
 * ## Interpolation modes (§17)
 *
 * `"step" | "linear" | "cubic" | "hermite"`, plus §17's fifth entry — "spherical
 * linear interpolation for quaternions" — which is not a separate mode here but
 * a property of the quaternion *adapter*: `quaternionAdapter.lerp` is
 * `Quaternion.slerp`, shortest-arc. A quaternion track in `"linear"` mode
 * therefore slerps, which is exactly what §17 asks for, without letting a caller
 * select a nonsensical component-wise lerp of a rotation.
 *
 * `"cubic"` and `"hermite"` need more than an adapter can express — they take
 * weighted sums of four values, not a two-point mix — so they read a value's
 * numeric components directly, chosen by {@link ValueAdapter.kind}. They are
 * available for `number`, `vector2`, `vector3`, `vector4`, and `color`, and are
 * rejected at construction for `quaternion` (cubic quaternion interpolation is
 * squad, which needs its own log/exp machinery and is out of Phase 4 scope),
 * `boolean`, and `discrete` (no meaningful arithmetic). A custom adapter
 * inherits the rules of the `kind` it declares, so it must use a kind whose
 * runtime shape matches — `number` → a number, `vector3` → an object with
 * `x`/`y`/`z`, `color` → a 4-element array — or stay on `"step"`/`"linear"`.
 *
 * ## Allocation (§7b, plan D7)
 *
 * Construction allocates (it copies its input arrays). {@link
 * AnimationTrack.sample} allocates nothing, ever: the span search is integer
 * arithmetic, the two-point modes delegate to the adapter's `out` path, and the
 * cubic and Hermite modes work in a per-instance `Float64Array` sized once at
 * construction.
 *
 * `sample` honours the same return-value contract as the adapters: it **returns
 * the effective value**, which is the mutated `out` for in-place kinds and the
 * value itself for primitives and discrete values (see `./values.js`). `out`
 * must not alias any of the track's keyframe values.
