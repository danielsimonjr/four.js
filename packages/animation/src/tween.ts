/**
 * Tweens (§15).
 *
 * §15's example is the whole API in four lines:
 *
 * ```ts
 * Four.animate(node.position)
 *   .to({ x: 10, y: 5 }, 1.0)
 *   .ease("cubic-out")
 *   .play();
 * ```
 *
 * {@link animate} is that entry point ({@link Four} is the umbrella namespace,
 * plan P4-4 — this package owns the function). {@link tween} is §16's one-shot
 * form, `tween(target, props, seconds)`, which builds the same object without
 * playing it so a timeline can own its playback.
 *
 * ## Evaluation is a pure function of local time (§16)
 *
 * §16 requires that "evaluating at time `t` always produces the same values,
 * which is what scrubbing and deterministic evaluation require". A tween here
 * holds exactly one piece of mutable playback state — its local time — and
 * every value it writes is derived from that number alone:
 *
 * ```text
 * value = adapter.lerp(start, end, easing(progress(localTime)))
 * ```
 *
 * `start` and `end` are captured once, at {@link Tween.play}, and never read
 * back from the live property afterwards. Consequently {@link Tween.seek}
 * called twice with the same argument writes byte-identical values, and
 * scrubbing backwards is exactly as valid as scrubbing forwards — the tween
 * cannot accumulate error because it never integrates.
 *
 * ## No clocks (plan P4-1, §33)
 *
 * A tween never reads a clock. Local time advances only through
 * {@link Tween.advance}, which the fixed-step `AnimationSystem` (WP-4.6) calls
 * with the scaled simulation delta, and through {@link Tween.seek}. Nothing in
 * this module touches `Date.now`, `performance.now`, or `Math.random`, and the
 * only iteration order is insertion order.
 *
 * ## Exact landings
 *
 * `values.ts` warns that `a + (b - a) * t` is not guaranteed to return exactly
 * `b` at `t = 1`, and tells tweens to "assign the end value at completion
 * instead of lerping to it". This module does precisely that: an eased progress
 * of exactly `1` assigns {@link TweenEntry.end}, and exactly `0` assigns the
 * captured start, so a tween lands on the values it was authored with —
 * including the start value at the end of an odd yoyo cycle.
 *
 * ## Change hooks (plan D3)
 *
 * `Vector3.x` is a plain field, so `binding.set` on the path `"x"` is a direct
 * field write and, as `vector3.ts` says, "direct field writes bypass the hook
 * by design". §15's own example animates `{ x, y }` of a transform's position,
 * so a tween that ignored this would leave `Transform.version` stale and the
 * local matrix never recomposed. After every write through a
 * `mutatesInPlace: false` adapter this module therefore invokes the owner's
 * `onChanged` hook if it has one — restoring exactly the notification a
 * `position.set(...)` call would have produced. In-place adapters need nothing:
 * `adapter.copy` is a math method and fires the hook itself.
 *
 * ## Allocation (§7b)
 *
 * {@link Tween.play} allocates: three clones per animated property (start, end,
 * and the `out` scratch the in-place adapters interpolate into). After that the
 * advance path allocates nothing at all — no math objects, no closures, no
 * iterators over the entry array.

/**
 * A §15 tween: the builder and the playing object in one.
 *
 * Configuration methods (`to`, `from`, `ease`, `delay`, `repeat`, `yoyo`,
 * `speed`, `authority`, `onComplete`) return `this` and are legal only before
 * {@link Tween.play}; calling one afterwards throws, because start values,
 * bindings, and property claims are all fixed at play time and a late change
 * would silently mean something different than it reads. Playback controls
 * (`play`, `pause`, `resume`, `advance`, `seek`, `stop`) return `this` too, so
 * §15's chain reads exactly as written.
 *
 * ## Timing
 *
 * ```text
 * localTime                              (seconds, advanced by `advance`)
 *   ├── delay ──┤├── duration ──┤├── duration ──┤ …  repeat + 1 cycles
 * ```
 *
 * `advance(dt)` adds `dt * speed`. Time inside the delay produces progress `0`
 * (the start pose is written, so `from()` is visible immediately). Beyond the
 * delay, local time folds into `[0, duration]` once per cycle; with
 * {@link Tween.yoyo} every odd cycle is reflected, so the tween walks back to
 * its start value. `repeat(Infinity)` makes the total duration infinite and the
 * tween never finishes.
 *
 * A completing `advance` clamps local time to exactly the total duration, which
 * is why a tween lands exactly on its end value at `t = duration` rather than
 * wherever the last delta happened to overshoot to.
 *
 * ## Conflicts (§16) and authority (§42)
 *
 * {@link Tween.play} claims every property it animates. Claiming one another
 * tween already holds emits a development warning and revokes the earlier
 * tween's claim *on that property only* — the earlier tween keeps animating
 * everything else, and is effectively stopped only if it loses all of its
 * properties. {@link Tween.stop} and natural completion release claims.
 *
 * Properties inside a node's transform are additionally gated on §42 authority:
 * see {@link Tween.authority} for how the node is found, and the class body for
 * what a refusal does.
