/**
 * The fixed-step animation system (§39 step 3, plan decision P4-1).
 *
 * §39 gives the engine one extension point for per-fixed-step work, and its
 * step 3 is "animation target evaluation". {@link AnimationSystem} is that step:
 * a `SimulationSystem` that advances every tracked tween, timeline, and clip
 * mixer once per fixed simulation step.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const animation = new AnimationSystem();
 * app.systems.register(animation);          // priority 300 (§39 step 3)
 * app.systems.register(new MotionSystem()); // priority 400 (§39 step 4)
 *
 * animation.track(animate(node).to({ "transform.position.x": 5 }, 1).play());
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why the fixed step (P4-1)
 *
 * Animation could plausibly run on the variable `update` — it is presentation,
 * not simulation. It does not, for three stated reasons:
 *
 * 1. **§16 deterministic evaluation.** A fixed delta makes the sequence of local
 *    times a tween sees a function of the step count alone, not of frame rate.
 * 2. **§34 replay.** Replaying an injected elapsed-time sequence reproduces the
 *    same fixed steps, so it reproduces the same animation, marker firings
 *    included.
 * 3. **§19 blending.** The physics-animation pipeline is *animation pose →
 *    kinematic modification → physics solve*, all inside one step; an animation
 *    pose produced on a different clock could not feed it.
 *
 * The cost is stated too: a non-transform property (an opacity, a material
 * color) steps at the fixed rate rather than the display rate. At the Appendix A
 * default of 60 Hz that is invisible; a variable-rate tier, if it is ever
 * needed, is a second system rather than a change to this one.
 *
 * Transforms written here reach the screen through the existing §43 pose
 * interpolation, which already interpolates between the previous and current
 * fixed-step pose — nothing in this file knows about rendering.
 *
 * ## Ordering (P4-1: before `MotionSystem`)
 *
 * §19's pipeline requires animation to run **before** kinematic motion. The
 * system cannot enforce that from inside — ordering belongs to the §39 registry
 * — so it declares it the way §39 says to: {@link PRIORITY_ANIMATION_TARGETS}
 * (300) is strictly below `MotionSystem`'s {@link PRIORITY_KINEMATICS} (400),
 * and `SystemRegistry` runs systems in ascending priority **regardless of
 * registration order**. Two systems that share a priority run in registration
 * order. Both facts are asserted in `tests/animation-system.test.ts`, because
 * "registered before MotionSystem" is a claim about the registry, not about a
 * comment.
 *
 * ## No clocks (§33)
 *
 * The delta comes from the injected `FixedUpdateContext`; nothing here reads
 * `Date.now`, `performance.now`, or `Math.random`, and the tracked set is
 * iterated in insertion order only.

/**
 * Advances every tracked animation player once per fixed step (§39 step 3).
 *
 * ## Which players it advances (decision, WP-4.6)
 *
 * Explicit registration, exactly as `MotionSystem` tracks nodes: a player is
 * advanced because {@link AnimationSystem.track} was called with it. A tween
 * does not attach itself to a system — it has no way to know which system, or
 * which application, should own it — so `play()` starts a tween and `track()`
 * makes something move it.
 *
 * ## Auto-untracking (decision, WP-4.6)
 *
 * After advancing a player the system drops it if it is `finished` **or**
 * `"stopped"`, because those are precisely the states from which `advance` can
 * never do anything again:
 *
 * | state       | advance does | tracked after the step |
 * | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
 * | `"running"` | animates     | yes                    |
 * | `"paused"`  | nothing      | yes — `resume()` revives it |
 * | `"idle"`    | nothing      | yes — `play()` revives it   |
 * | `"finished"`| nothing      | **no**                 |
 * | `"stopped"` | nothing      | **no**                 |
 *
 * Keeping a finished tween would cost a call per step forever and hold its
 * target alive; dropping a paused or idle one would silently break the two
 * legitimate ways of resuming. A finished player is *not* stopped by the system:
 * it keeps its values and can still be scrubbed with `seek`, and a caller that
 * wants its §16 property claims released calls `stop()` itself.
 *
 * ## Mutation during a step
 *
 * The tracked set is a `Set` iterated live, mirroring `MotionSystem` (a snapshot
 * would allocate every step). The consequences, which are `Set` semantics:
 * a player untracked during the step — including by the system's own
 * auto-untracking, and by an `onComplete` callback — is not advanced again in
 * that step, and one tracked during the step *is* advanced in the same step.
 * Track and untrack outside the step if that distinction matters.
