/**
 * The clip player (§17 clips, §16 playback semantics, §107 "playback controls").
 *
 * An {@link AnimationClip} is data: tracks over clip-local time plus markers. An
 * {@link AnimationMixer} is what plays one onto a target — it owns the bindings,
 * the local clock, the loop count, the speed, and the §16 marker history that a
 * clip deliberately has none of:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const mixer = new AnimationMixer(node);
 * mixer.play(clip, { loop: 2, onEvent: (event) => spawn(event.name) });
 * // …each fixed step (AnimationSystem, plan P4-1):
 * mixer.advance(time.fixedDeltaTime);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Bindings are resolved once (§16)
 *
 * Every track's path is resolved against the target **once**, at
 * {@link AnimationMixer.play}, through `createBinding` — §16's "string-path
 * convenience forms are resolved once, at creation time". The resolved owner is
 * kept for the mixer's whole life, so replacing `target.transform` afterwards
 * does not silently redirect the animation; and because the binding array is
 * index-parallel with `clip.tracks`, sampling is an indexed walk with no lookup.
 *
 * Each track is also checked against the property it resolved to: a `vector3`
 * track bound to a number is a configuration error and throws at `play`, not a
 * mysterious `NaN` three seconds in. Discrete tracks are the one kind that binds
 * to anything, because assignment always works.
 *
 * ## Evaluation is a pure function of clip time (§16, §9)
 *
 * {@link AnimationMixer.seek} and {@link AnimationMixer.advance} share one code
 * path: both position the clip clock and sample every track at that time.
 * Nothing integrates, so evaluating twice at the same time writes byte-identical
 * values and scrubbing backwards is exactly as valid as scrubbing forwards. Time
 * is clip-local seconds (§9: "animation time is clip-local and lives on players
 * and timelines, not in the global `TimeState`"; §7a: seconds, never
 * milliseconds) and never comes from a clock — only from `advance`/`seek`
 * (§33).
 *
 * ## Markers are not a function of time
 *
 * Clip events fire **once per forward crossing** during playback, through
 * `clip.eventsInRange`'s half-open `(from, to]` convention, so consecutive
 * advances neither miss an event nor repeat one. Looping re-arms them. A
 * {@link AnimationMixer.seek} fires nothing unless the play was configured
 * `{ replayOnSeek: true }`, which is §16's "opt-in per-marker replay-on-seek
 * policy" expressed per playback — a clip's `AnimationEvent` has no policy field
 * to opt in with (see {@link MixerPlayOptions.replayOnSeek}).
 *
 * ## Conflicts (§16) and authority (§42)
 *
 * The mixer claims every property it animates in the **same** module-level
 * registry `Tween` uses (`./tween.js`), so a tween and a mixer fighting over one
 * property resolve last-started-wins with a warning, exactly as two tweens do.
 * Transform writes are gated on §42 authority with `Tween`'s semantics: the
 * authority node is the target when the target is a `Node`, or
 * {@link MixerPlayOptions.authority} otherwise; a refusal warns once and skips
 * **every** transform write of that evaluation, never a partial pose, while
 * non-transform tracks keep animating.
 *
 * ## Root motion (§19, plan P7-5)
 *
 * {@link MixerPlayOptions.rootMotion} turns one designated track from an
 * absolute pose channel into a *locomotion* channel: the mixer stops writing its
 * sampled values anywhere and instead adds their per-advance **difference** to a
 * designated node's `transform.position`. That is what makes a walk cycle
 * authored in place move a character, and what lets the same clip loop forever
 * without teleporting back to the origin. See {@link MixerRootMotionOptions} for
 * the loop-aware derivation; rotational root motion is staged (2026-08-02).
 *
 * ## Allocation (§7b)
 *
 * {@link AnimationMixer.play} allocates: one binding, one scratch value, and one
 * claim per track, plus six vectors when root motion is configured. After that
 * the advance path allocates nothing — the sample sink and the event visitor are
 * built once per mixer, and every track writes through its own scratch.

/**
 * Root motion for one playback (§19, plan decision P7-5) — the MVP tier:
 * **translation only**.
 *
 * The designated track is removed from normal per-track binding. Its path is
 * never resolved against the mixer's target, its absolute values never write a
 * bound property, and it needs no property to exist at all: `"rootMotion"` is a
 * perfectly good path for a channel that exists only to be differenced. What the
 * mixer does with it instead is add the *change* in its sampled value across
 * each {@link AnimationMixer.advance} to
 * `target.transform.position`.
 *
 * ## The loop-aware delta, derived
 *
 * Let `S(t)` be the track sampled at clip-local time `t`, `d` the clip duration,
 * and let one advance move elapsed time from `a` to `b` (`a <= b`). Inside a
 * single iteration the answer is the plain difference `S(l(b)) − S(l(a))`, where
 * `l` is the clip-local time of an elapsed time.
 *
 * A wrap is where naive differencing fails: `l` jumps from `d` back to `0`, so
 * `S(l(b)) − S(l(a))` would subtract a whole stride and teleport the node
 * backwards. The honest quantity is the distance travelled *along* the clip, so
 * the crossing is split at the seam — the motion left in the outgoing iteration
 * plus the motion already made in the incoming one:
 *
 * ```text
 * (S(d) − S(l(a)))  +  (S(l(b)) − S(0))
 * ```
 *
 * An advance long enough to swallow whole iterations adds one full **stride**
 * `S(d) − S(0)` for each of them, which generalizes both cases to
 *
 * ```text
 * w = iteration(b) − iteration(a)                       // wraps crossed
 * w = 0:  S(l(b)) − S(l(a))
 * w > 0:  (S(d) − S(l(a))) + (w − 1)·(S(d) − S(0)) + (S(l(b)) − S(0))
 * ```
 *
 * `iteration` and `l` are the mixer's own loop bookkeeping (the same functions
 * that place the pose), so root motion wraps exactly when playback does — and,
 * because the last iteration's end reads as `l = d` rather than `l = 0` of an
 * iteration that does not exist, the advance that finishes a `loop(n)` playback
 * contributes the full `n`-th stride.
 *
 * `S(l(a))`, `S(d)`, and `S(0)` are all held from the previous advance or frozen
 * at play, so a step costs exactly one new sample and no allocation.
 *
 * ## What does *not* accumulate
 *
 * - {@link AnimationMixer.seek} applies no delta at all. It repositions the
 *   left endpoint so the next advance differences from the sought time, and
 *   nothing more: §16 makes evaluation a pure function of clip time, and a
 *   scrub that also *moved* the character would make scrubbing back and forth
 *   a source of displacement. A seek positions; only an advance locomotes.
 * - A delta refused by §42 (see below) is **dropped**, not banked. The left
 *   endpoint still advances, so authority granted mid-playback resumes from the
 *   clip's current position rather than replaying the motion that was refused —
 *   the same "never depended on the writes that were refused" property the pose
 *   path has.
 *
 * ## Authority (§42)
 *
 * The write lands on {@link MixerRootMotionOptions.target}'s transform, so that
 * node must be under `"animation"` authority — independently of whatever node
 * gates the pose, which is often a different one (the pose animates a skeleton
 * under a root the motion moves). A node that is not warns once (deduplicated by
 * `warnAuthorityConflict`) and its deltas are skipped.
 *
 * ## Staged
 *
 * Rotational root motion — differencing a quaternion track and rotating the
 * target — is **not implemented** (staged 2026-08-02, plan P7-5). A `rootMotion`
 * naming a quaternion track throws `FourError("NOT_IMPLEMENTED")` rather than
 * silently animating only half of the intended motion.
