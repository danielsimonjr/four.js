 *
 * ## Scope — what §36 this is, and what it is not
 *
 * §36's option sketch is `{ maxParticles, simulation: "gpu", forces, collisions:
 * "depth-buffer" }` and its feature list runs to eleven items. Plan P9-1 pins
 * the MVP tier and this packet ships that tier:
 *
 * | §36 feature                 | WP-9.1                                        |
 * | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
 * | CPU simulation              | **ships** (this module)                       |
 * | emitters, lifetimes         | **ships**                                     |
 * | velocity distributions      | **ships** — seeded cone, speed range           |
 * | forces                      | **ships** — gravity + §27 fields (WP-9.2 implements the fields) |
 * | colour and size over lifetime | **ships** — two-stop linear ramp            |
 * | collision                   | **MVP tier** — `collisionPlaneY` bounce, plus `collisions: "depth-buffer"` kill-below-ground |
 * | GPU compute simulation      | **integrator tier ships** (R-31 wiring, 2026-08-29): `simulation: "gpu"` + a bound {@link ParticleGpuSimulation} — CPU spawn, GPU semi-implicit Euler under constant gravity plus an optional radial field. `collisions: "depth-buffer"` is accepted; the device rests particles on `y = ground` (a documented stub — true depth-texture collide-and-kill is staged). |
 * | trails, attractors, custom data channels | staged (2026-08-02, P9-1): trails need a per-particle position-history channel (a ring buffer per slot) plus a ribbon render path — neither the SoA pool nor the "particles" render item carries history, and shipping a one-sample "trail" would be a lie; attractors are expressible today as a negative-strength {@link ../fields.js radialField}; custom data channels want a pool-layout extension API |
 *
 * `collisions: "depth-buffer"` is now an accepted option (R-31 residue /
 * R-32): the CPU path kills particles whose `y` falls below the ground
 * (`collisionPlaneY`, or `0` when omitted). A GPU emitter accepts the same
 * spelling; the device kernel rests those particles on the plane rather than
 * sampling a scene depth texture — documented, not silent. Rendering is
 * WP-9.3; nothing in this module draws, owns a node, or reads a clock.
 *
 * ## GPU mode (§36 "GPU compute simulation" — the R-31 wiring, 2026-08-29)
 *
 * With `simulation: "gpu"` this emitter keeps every §33-bearing decision on
 * the CPU — spawn draws, bursts, the accumulator, ageing, expiry, ramps —
 * and delegates the per-particle integration to a bound
 * {@link ParticleGpuSimulation} (`types.ts` owns the contract, the
 * division-of-labour argument, and the §33/§34 posture). Consequences,
 * stated plainly:
 *
 * - **The pool's position/velocity lanes hold spawn-time values only.**
 *   The live state is device-resident and is drawn from the device (the
 *   WebGPU backend binds the simulation's position buffer as the instance
 *   position stream, keyed by the emitting node's id); it is never read
 *   back per frame, because a per-frame readback would forfeit the point.
 * - **A GPU emitter must be bound before it steps or emits** —
 *   {@link ParticleEmitter.bindGpuSimulation}; an unbound `step()`/`emit()`
 *   throws rather than silently simulating nothing (§85, the WP-9.1 rule
 *   again). Binding is once: a driver's device dying takes the particle
 *   state with it (§34 posture in `types.ts`), so recovery is a new
 *   emitter, not a rebind.
 * - **Non-radial `fields` and bounce-only `collisionPlaneY` are refused**
 *   in GPU mode. A `radialField` (the `gpuField` brand) is applied on the
 *   device with the same inverse-square law as the CPU path. `collisions:
 *   "depth-buffer"` is accepted as the ground-rest stub above.
 * - The step order is the CPU order with integration hoisted: one
 *   `integrate()` over the pre-expiry live count (every live particle
 *   integrates exactly once, as on the CPU, where the swap-remove re-process
 *   guarantees the same), then the age/expiry scan mirroring each
 *   swap-remove to the device via `moveSlot`, then spawns via `writeSpawn`.
 *
 * ## The step, in order (pinned, WP-9.1)
 *
 * `step(deltaSeconds, time)` does exactly this, in exactly this order:
 *
 * 1. **Simulate every live particle**, ascending index:
 *    1. acceleration = `gravity` + each field's `sample(...)`, **in declaration
 *       order**;
 *    2. **semi-implicit (symplectic) Euler**: `v += a·dt` then `p += v·dt`;
 *    3. plane collision, if `collisionPlaneY` is set;
 *    4. `age += dt`;
 *    5. if `age >= lifetime`, swap-remove it and re-process the slot (the swap
 *       moved an unprocessed particle in).
 * 2. **Spawn**: bursts whose time falls in `[elapsed, elapsed + dt)`, in
 *    declaration order, then the rate-driven emission for this step.
 * 3. `elapsed += dt`.
 *
 * Simulating before spawning is what gives the age invariant: **a particle's age
 * is exactly `dt` × the number of steps in which it was integrated**, so a
 * particle spawned during step *n* sits at its spawn position with age 0 at the
 * end of step *n*, and first moves in step *n + 1*. That is what makes the
 * closed forms below exact rather than off-by-one-step.
 *
 * ### The integrator, in closed form
 *
 * Semi-implicit Euler under a constant acceleration `g` from `(p₀, v₀)` gives,
 * after *n* steps of `dt`:
 *
 * ```text
 * vₙ = v₀ + n·g·dt
 * pₙ = p₀ + n·v₀·dt + g·dt²·(1 + 2 + … + n)
 *    = p₀ + v₀·t + ½·g·t·(t + dt)          with t = n·dt
 * ```
 *
 * — the continuous `p₀ + v₀t + ½gt²` plus a `½·g·t·dt` discretisation bias that
 * vanishes with `dt`. `tests/emitter.test.ts` pins this exactly; it is the
 * discrete truth, and rounding it to the continuous formula in a test would be
 * pretending the simulation is something it is not.
 *
 * Semi-implicit rather than explicit Euler because it is the engine's default
 * (`@four/motion`'s `DEFAULT_INTEGRATOR`) and does not pump energy into orbiting
 * particles under a radial field. It is **inlined here** rather than delegated to
 * `@four/motion`'s `semiImplicitEuler`: §3.1 gives particles no motion
 * dependency, and the inline form works on `Float32Array` lanes without boxing
 * each particle into an `IntegratorState`.
 *
 * ## Randomness and the per-particle draw order (pinned, WP-9.1)
 *
 * §33 forbids `Math.random`; every spawn draw comes from this emitter's own
 * {@link SeededRandom} (see `random.ts` for why the generator is a copy).
 *
 * **Each successfully spawned particle consumes exactly
 * {@link PARTICLE_DRAWS_PER_SPAWN} = 4 draws, always, in this order:**
 *
 * 1. `lifetime` — `nextRange(lifetime.min, lifetime.max)`
 * 2. `speed` — `nextRange(initialSpeed.min, initialSpeed.max)`
 * 3. cone azimuth `φ` — `nextRange(0, 2π)`
 * 4. cone polar `u` — `nextFloat01()`, mapped to `cos θ = 1 − u·(1 − cos spread)`
 *
 * The count and the order are **fixed, not conditional**: a zero `spreadAngle`
 * or a degenerate range still consumes its draws. That is deliberate — it means
 * widening a cone or changing a lifetime range shifts *those particles'* values
 * and nothing else's, instead of re-phasing the whole stream. Adding a fifth
 * draw later is a breaking change to every §33 golden, by design.
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating plainly:
 *
 * - **Draws are consumed only by *successful* spawns.** A spawn that finds the
 *   pool full is dropped before it draws (it is counted in
 *   {@link ParticleEmitter.droppedCount}). This keeps a saturated
 *   100 000-particle emitter from burning four RNG draws per dropped spawn every
 *   step — but it does mean **`maxParticles` is part of the determinism
 *   contract**: the same seed with a different capacity is a different stream
 *   once the pool saturates.
 * - **The stream is per emitter.** Nothing is module-level, so two emitters with
 *   the same seed reproduce each other regardless of what else the scene does.
 *
 * ## Determinism (§33)
 *
 * Same seed + same `(deltaSeconds, time)` sequence ⇒ **bit-identical pools**,
 * tested over 600 steps with spawns, deaths, fields, and bounces active. The
 * ingredients: a seeded stream, a fixed draw order, ascending-index iteration,
 * a fixed acceleration summation order (gravity, then fields in declaration
 * order — floating-point addition is not associative, so this is a contract and
 * not an implementation detail), and the pool's deterministic swap-remove
 * compaction (see `pool.ts`).
 *
 * ## Allocation (§7b, plan D7)
 *
 * **`step()` allocates nothing.** Three scratch `Vector3`s are built in the
 * constructor and reused: two carry the particle's position and velocity into
 * `ParticleForceField.sample`, one is the `out` it writes. Options are copied
 * into plain number fields and own arrays at construction, so no option object
 * is read on the hot path and later mutation of the caller's arrays cannot
 * change the simulation. Loops are indexed (`for (let i = …)`) rather than
 * `for…of`, which would allocate an iterator per loop.
 *
 * Consequence of the shared scratch: a `ParticleForceField.sample`
 * implementation must not re-enter the *same* emitter's `step()`. Nothing in the
 * engine does.
