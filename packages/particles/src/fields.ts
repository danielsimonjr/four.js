/**
 * The §27 built-in force fields, MVP tier (plan P9-2, WP-9.2).
 *
 * ```ts
 * const emitter = new ParticleEmitter({
 *   maxParticles: 4096,
 *   emissionRate: 500,
 *   fields: [
 *     uniformGravityField(),                       // (0, −9.81, 0)
 *     dragField(0.4),                              // a = −0.4·v
 *     volumeField(vortexField(new Vector3(), new Vector3(0, 1, 0), 12), {
 *       shape: "sphere",
 *       center: new Vector3(),
 *       radius: 5,
 *       falloff: 1,                                // 1-unit edge fade
 *     }),

 *   ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Everything here implements {@link ParticleForceField} — §27's `ForceField`,
 * transcribed in `types.ts` — so anything in this module can be handed to
 * `ParticleEmitter`'s `fields` option, and a hand-written field is just as valid
 * as a built-in one. Nothing here knows about emitters, pools, or nodes.
 *
 * ## What a sampled vector means
 *
 * **An acceleration in units/s²** (`types.ts`, WP-9.1: MVP particles carry no
 * mass channel, so a "force" field is authored as an acceleration). Times are
 * seconds, angles radians, and the world is right-handed **Y-up in both 2D and
 * 3D** (§7a) — so "down" is −Y in a 2D scene too.
 *
 * ## §27's built-in list, and what this packet actually ships (honest scope)
 *
 * | §27 built-in            | WP-9.2                                            |
 * | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
 * | uniform gravity         | **ships** — {@link uniformGravityField}            |
 * | radial gravity          | **ships** — {@link radialField} (negative strength) |
 * | vortex                  | **ships** — {@link vortexField}                    |
 * | wind                    | **ships** — {@link windField}                      |
 * | drag volume             | **ships** — {@link dragField} + {@link volumeField} |
 * | turbulence/noise        | **ships** — {@link turbulenceField}, with the honesty note below |
 * | spring field            | **staged** — a spring field wants a rest *target* per particle (§27 gives none) and reads as an attractor with a linear law; {@link radialField} is inverse-square only, so shipping "spring" as a relabelled radial would be a lie |
 * | user-defined callback   | **already possible** — an object literal with a `sample` method *is* the interface; no wrapper is shipped because there is nothing for it to do |
 * | GPU field               | **staged** (2026-08-02) — needs the WebGPU compute path, itself staged by plan P9-1 |
 * | volume inclusion/filtering | **ships, MVP** — {@link volumeField}: axis-aligned sphere and box, with an edge fade. Rotated boxes, cylinders, capsules, meshes, and inversion are staged |
 *
 * Nothing here is accepted-and-ignored: an option that silently does nothing is
 * worse than one that does not exist yet.
 *
 * ## Shared contract for every field in this module
 *
 * 1. **Constructor arguments are copied.** A `Vector3` passed in is read into
 *    scalars at construction; mutating it afterwards does not change the field.
 *    (Runtime re-authoring is deliberately absent, exactly as in `emitter.ts`.)
 * 2. **Arguments are validated eagerly**, with `RangeError`, at construction —
 *    a field is authored once and sampled millions of times, so a `NaN` strength
 *    should fail where it was written, not as an invisible pool of `NaN`
 *    positions ten seconds later.
 * 3. **`sample` allocates nothing.** Each field owns one scratch `Vector3`,
 *    built at construction, and returns it when the caller omits `out`. Per the
 *    `types.ts` contract that vector is valid only until the next call on the
 *    *same* field.
 * 4. **`sample` never mutates `position` or `velocity`**, and reads every
 *    component it needs into locals *before* writing `out`. Sampling with
 *    `out === position` therefore produces the correct answer rather than
 *    garbage — {@link volumeField} inherits that only if its inner field has it,
 *    which every field here does.
 * 5. **`sample` is a pure function of its arguments** (§33): no clock, no
 *    `Math.random`, no hidden state. {@link turbulenceField} takes an explicit
 *    seed and draws from {@link SeededRandom} once, at construction.
 *
 * ## A note on the emitter's summation order
 *
 * `ParticleEmitter` sums `gravity`, then each field's sample **in declaration
 * order**. Floating-point addition is not associative, so the order of the
 * `fields` array is part of the determinism contract (§33) and not a cosmetic
 * detail. Fields that read `velocity` ({@link dragField}, {@link windField}) see
 * the velocity **at the start of the step** — the emitter samples every field
 * before integrating, so drag never sees another field's contribution within the
 * same step. That is what makes the closed forms in `tests/fields.test.ts`
 * exact.

 * - **`coefficient · dt < 1` or the sign flips each step**; at

 *   is not known here, and silently capping a coefficient would make the closed
 *   form false.
 * - **Terminal velocity under a constant `g` is `g / coefficient`**, so
 *   `coefficient` reads as an inverse time constant in s⁻¹, not as a mass- or
 *   area-dependent physical drag coefficient.
 *
 * Quadratic drag is **staged**: it needs a documented low-speed regularisation

 *
 * ## Exactly what this is (honesty statement, WP-9.2)
 *
 * It is the **central-difference curl of a three-channel hash-based value-noise
 * vector potential, normalised by the stencil's analytic maximum**. Written out,
 * with `s = (position − scroll·time) · frequency` in lattice space and
 * `d = `{@link TURBULENCE_DIFFERENCE_CELLS}:
 *
 * ```text
 * ψc(s)  = trilinear-interpolated value noise, channel c ∈ {x, y, z},
 *          quintic fade, lattice values hashed from the seed;  |ψc| ≤ 1
 *
 * aₓ = (amplitude / 4) · [ (ψz(s + d·ŷ) − ψz(s − d·ŷ)) − (ψy(s + d·ẑ) − ψy(s − d·ẑ)) ]
 * a_y = (amplitude / 4) · [ (ψx(s + d·ẑ) − ψx(s − d·ẑ)) − (ψz(s + d·x̂) − ψz(s − d·x̂)) ]
 * a_z = (amplitude / 4) · [ (ψy(s + d·x̂) − ψy(s − d·x̂)) − (ψx(s + d·ŷ) − ψx(s − d·ŷ)) ]
 * ```
 *
 * The `/4` is the normalisation: each bracket is a difference of two differences
 * of values in `[−1, 1]`, so it lies in `[−4, 4]`, and hence
 * **`|componentᵢ| ≤ |amplitude|` always**. That bound is what the tests assert.
 *
 * ### Limitations — all of them, stated plainly
 *
 * - **It is value noise, not Perlin or simplex noise.** The lattice values are
 *   scalars hashed from the integer cell corners and interpolated; there are no
 *   gradients. Value noise is cheaper and easier to bound, but it has visible
 *   **axis-aligned structure** and a blockier spectrum than gradient noise. It
 *   is one octave: there is no fBm/fractal sum, so there is exactly one eddy
 *   size, `1 / frequency` world units. Octaves are staged (they multiply the
 *   96-hash cost per sample by the octave count).
 * - **The curl is a finite difference, not an analytic derivative, and the
 *   field is _not_ divergence-free in any useful sense.** Central-difference
 *   operators commute, so the divergence measured with *this very stencil and
 *   step* is zero — measured, 3.4 × 10⁻¹⁵, i.e. float rounding. That is a
 *   lattice identity, not a property of the field: measured with a step of
 *   `0.37·d` instead, the divergence is ≈ 0.54 at the defaults, which is not
 *   small. **No incompressibility claim is made and none is tested.** Treat
 *   "curl of a potential" as a description of the construction — it is what
 *   makes the field swirl instead of converging on sinks — not as physics.
 * - **`amplitude` is an upper bound, not a typical magnitude.** The worst case
 *   needs four lattice corners to hit `±1` in the right pattern. Measured over
 *   20 000 seeded sample points (60 000 components) spread over ±50 world units,
 *   at frequencies 0.25, 1 and 4: the **RMS of a single component is
 *   ≈ 0.186·amplitude** and the **largest component seen is ≈ 0.76·amplitude**,
 *   essentially independent of frequency. Author with that factor in mind, or
 *   measure your own configuration; `tests/fields.test.ts` pins a conservative
 *   version of the same statement.
 * - **Time does nothing unless {@link TurbulenceFieldOptions.scroll} is set.**
 *   See that option: the pattern is frozen and advected, not evolving.
 * - **The lattice is unbounded but not infinite-precision.** Cell indices go
 *   through `ToUint32` inside the hash, so coordinates beyond ±2³¹ cells alias
 *   back onto the pattern. At the default frequency that is ±2 billion world
 *   units.
 * - **Non-finite input gives `NaN` out.** Nothing is guarded on the hot path.
 * - The field is smooth: the quintic fade makes each `ψc` C², so the sampled
 *   acceleration is C² in space and Lipschitz — no popping as a particle
 *   crosses a cell boundary.
 *
 * ## Determinism (§33)
 *
 * `Math.random` is never called. The constructor draws exactly **three**
 * `uint32`s from `new SeededRandom(seed)` — one salt per channel — and every
 * lattice value afterwards is an integer hash of `(cell x, cell y, cell z,
 * salt)` built from `Math.imul`, xor and shift, all of which ECMAScript defines
 * bit-exactly on every engine. The same seed therefore gives the same field
 * everywhere and forever, and two fields with the same seed are
 * indistinguishable. The seed is a uint32 under the same `ToUint32` reduction
 * {@link SeededRandom} documents.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * One sample evaluates 12 scalar noises × 8 lattice hashes = **96 hashes**. It
 * is by a wide margin the most expensive field here; wrap it in
 * {@link volumeField} to pay for it only where it shows.
 *
 * @param seed uint32 stream seed (§33).
 * @throws RangeError if `seed` is not finite (via {@link SeededRandom}), if
 * `frequency` is not finite or not `> 0`, or if `amplitude` or any component of
 * `scroll` is not finite.

 *
 * Both halves of §27's phrase are here: **inclusion** is the hard test (outside
 * the volume the field contributes exactly `(0, 0, 0)`), **filtering** is the
 * weight (`out = w · inner.sample(...)` with `w ∈ [0, 1]`).
 *
 * The weight is computed from the **position only** — never from velocity or
 * time — as `smoothstep(t)` where `t` is the normalised depth inside the edge
 * band, `smoothstep(t) = t²(3 − 2t)`. Smoothstep rather than a linear ramp
 * because a linear weight has a discontinuous derivative at both ends of the
 * band, which is visible as a crease when a particle drifts through it. The
 * weight is **monotone non-increasing** as the sample point moves outward along
 * any ray from the centre, on both shapes; for the box, `t` is the *minimum* of
 * the three per-axis depths, so the weight is governed by whichever face is
 * nearest and the fade bands simply overlap in the corners.
 *
 * **Outside the volume the inner field is not sampled at all.** That is the
 * performance point of wrapping {@link turbulenceField}, and it is observable:
 * an inner field that counted its calls would see fewer. Inner fields are
 * required to be pure (§33), so this is not a behavioural difference.
 *
 * Wrapping composes — `volumeField(volumeField(f, a), b)` multiplies the two
 * weights — but each layer costs a virtual call.
 *
 * @param inner The field to restrict. Sampled with the *same* `out` this field
 * was given, so a well-behaved inner field allocates nothing.
 * @param volume Sphere or box, copied.
