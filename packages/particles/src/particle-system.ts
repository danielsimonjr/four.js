/**
 * `ParticleSystem` (§39, §36, plan WP-9.4) — the fixed-step driver that steps
 * every tracked {@link ParticleEmitter} once per simulation step.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const particles = new ParticleSystem();
 * app.systems.register(particles);          // priority 500 (§39 step 5)
 *
 * const fountain = new ParticleRenderable(new ParticleEmitter({ … }));
 * app.scene.add(fountain);
 * particles.track(fountain.emitter);        // the emitter, not the renderable
 * ```
 *
 * Everything below is a decision this packet had to make and states its reason:
 * which §39 step particles belong to, what a system tracks, and — the one that
 * is easy to get wrong — which half of the frame repacks the GPU instances.
 *
 * ## `SimulationSystem`, implemented **structurally**
 *
 * §39's extension point is
 *
 * ```ts
 * interface SimulationSystem {
 *   priority: number;
 *   initialize(context: SimulationContext): void;
 *   fixedUpdate(context: FixedUpdateContext): void;
 *   dispose(): void;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * and it lives in `@four/motion`, which the frozen §3.1 dependency matrix does
 * **not** give `@four/particles` (this package gets `core`, `math`, `scene`, and
 * nothing else; `motion` sits in the same dispatch wave, so an edge to it is not
 * merely undeclared but ordering-illegal). This class therefore implements the
 * shape without naming it — exactly the arrangement `ParticleRenderable` uses
 * for `@four/render`'s `ParticleDrawable`, for the same reason, with the same
 * honest cost:
 *
 * > **Nothing type-checks the two declarations against each other.** A change to
 * > `SimulationSystem` will not fail this package's build; it will fail
 * > `tests/determinism/phase9-particles.test.ts`, which registers a
 * > `ParticleSystem` on a real `Application`'s registry — the one place in the
 * > repository that can see both packages — and which additionally asserts
 * > {@link PRIORITY_PARTICLES} against `@four/motion`'s own constant.
 *
 * {@link ParticleFixedUpdateContext} below is the *narrowest* view of §39's
 * `FixedUpdateContext` that this system actually reads: `time.fixedDeltaTime`
 * and `time.simulationTime`. Narrower is deliberate — it documents the whole
 * dependency in six lines, and TypeScript's method-parameter bivariance makes
 * the class assignable to `SimulationSystem` regardless.
 *
 * ## Priority: 500, §39 step 5 (decision, WP-9.4)
 *
 * §39's step 5 is **force generation**, and a particle step is, precisely, §27
 * force fields sampled and integrated: gravity, drag, wind, vortex, turbulence
 * (`fields.ts`). So {@link PRIORITY_PARTICLES} is `500` — numerically identical
 * to `@four/motion`'s `PRIORITY_FORCES`, restated here because the matrix
 * forbids importing it.
 *
 * What that buys, stated precisely rather than generously:
 *
 * - **After animation (300) and kinematics (400).** An emitter parented under an
 *   animated or path-following node sees *this* step's transform rather than the
 *   previous one, because the node's world matrix is resolved per fixed step
 *   (§7, spec rev 1.3). Today that is a guarantee about the *node*, not about
 *   the simulation: the MVP emitter spawns at a fixed `position` fixed at
 *   construction and simulates in the renderable's local space, so no particle
 *   currently reads an animated transform. The ordering is therefore correct in
 *   advance of a §36 `simulationSpace` option rather than load-bearing today,
 *   and saying otherwise would be inventing a dependency.
 * - **Before the physics solve (600).** Particles are decorative mass: they
 *   never write a rigid body, never enqueue a contact, and never read solver
 *   state — §36's collision tier here is the emitter's own `collisionPlaneY`,
 *   not a solver query. So this is *ordering hygiene*, not a data dependency:
 *   particles could equally run at 650 and nothing would change. It is stated as
 *   a convention so that the day particles do read solver output (§36's
 *   "depth-buffer" and full solver coupling are both staged), the default is
 *   already on the safe side of the solve.
 *
 * Equal priorities run in registration order, so a `ParticleSystem` and a force
 * generator both at 500 are ordered by whoever registered first — deterministic,
 * and irrelevant here because they touch disjoint state. Pass
 * `{ priority: … }` to move it; `PRIORITY_PARTICLES + 10` is the idiom the §39
 * constants are spaced for.
 *
 * ## What this system does **not** do: it never repacks instances
 *
 * The GPU-facing half of a particle system is
 * `ParticleRenderable.updateParticleInstances()`, and it is **not called here**.
 * `@four/render`'s `buildRenderList` calls it itself, from `collect()`, once per
 * list build — read `render-list.ts`: the branch that recognises a
 * `ParticleDrawable` calls `node.updateParticleInstances()` immediately before
 * filling the item that points at the array. That is a *render*-frame cadence,
 * not a fixed-step one, and it is the right one for two independent reasons:
 *
 * 1. **Frequency.** A fixed step at 60 Hz and a render frame at 144 Hz (or a
 *    render frame at 30 Hz and four fixed steps behind it) are different clocks
 *    (§9, §10). Repacking per fixed step would either do work no frame consumes
 *    or hand a frame an array one step stale.
 * 2. **Freshness by construction.** Because the repack happens inside the list
 *    build, the uploaded array physically cannot be older than the item that
 *    references it — including for a caller that stepped the simulation
 *    mid-frame.
 *
 * So the division is: **this system owns simulation, the render list owns
 * presentation**, and an application that registers a `ParticleSystem` and adds
 * a `ParticleRenderable` to the scene has wired both halves. Nothing else is
 * required, and calling `updateParticleInstances()` by hand stays harmless and
 * idempotent between steps.
 *
 * ## No clocks, no randomness of its own (§33)
 *
 * The delta and the time both come from the injected context; nothing here reads
 * `Date.now`, `performance.now`, or `Math.random`. Tracked emitters are iterated
 * in **insertion order** (a `Set`), so a scene with two emitters sharing a seed
 * reproduces step for step.

/**
 * Steps every tracked particle emitter once per fixed simulation step (§39
 * step 5).
 *
 * ## What it tracks: **emitters**, not renderables (decision, WP-9.4)
 *
 * `track` takes a {@link SteppableEmitter}. It does *not* take a
 * `ParticleRenderable`, and the demo composes accordingly
 * (`particles.track(fountain.emitter)`). Three reasons, in order of weight:
 *
 * 1. **A simulation must be drivable without a renderer.** The §112 benchmark
 *    (`benchmarks/particles-100k.mjs`) and the §33 golden
 *    (`tests/determinism/phase9-particles.test.ts`) both step 100 000 and 100
 *    particles respectively with no scene, no canvas and no render list. If the
 *    system took renderables, headless particle simulation would require
 *    constructing a node purely to throw it away.
 * 2. **The two halves have different owners and different cadences.** The
 *    renderable's per-frame job is driven by `buildRenderList` (see the module
 *    header); the emitter's per-step job is driven here. Tracking the renderable
 *    would suggest this system owns both, which is exactly the confusion the
 *    header exists to prevent.
 * 3. **`ParticleRenderable.emitter` is public for this.** It is documented as
 *    "public because the application steps it"; `system.track(r.emitter)` is
 *    that sentence, spelled.
 *
 * The cost, stated: one extra `.emitter` at the call site, and the possibility
 * of adding a renderable to the scene while forgetting to track its emitter —
 * which draws a static puff of particles rather than throwing. That failure is
 * visible in one frame, and the alternative failure (a headless simulation that
 * cannot be built) is not.
 *
 * ## No auto-untracking (decision, WP-9.4)
 *
 * `AnimationSystem` drops a player that is `finished` or `"stopped"`, because
 * those states are unrecoverable. An emitter has no such state: one with zero
 * live particles and no emission rate is exactly one burst away from being busy
 * again (`emitter.emit(n)`), and `reset()` revives any emitter at all. Dropping
 * a quiet emitter would silently break both. Emitters leave this system only
 * when something calls {@link ParticleSystem.untrack} or
 * {@link ParticleSystem.clear}.
 *
 * ## Mutation during a step
 *
 * The tracked set is a `Set` iterated live, mirroring `AnimationSystem` and
 * `MotionSystem` (a snapshot would allocate every step). Those are `Set`
 * semantics: an emitter untracked during the step is not stepped again in that
 * step, and one tracked during the step *is* stepped in the same step. Track and
 * untrack outside the step if that distinction matters.
 *
 * ## Allocation (§7b, plan D7)
 *
 * `fixedUpdate` allocates one `Set` iterator per step and nothing else — the
 * same one-per-step `AnimationSystem` and `MotionSystem` allocate, and the
 * reason the per-particle work inside `ParticleEmitter.step` is the part that is
 * strictly zero-allocation. At the §112 budget that is one small object against
 * 100 000 particles.

   *   from the emitter-local default. That is the right choice — two emitters in
   *   one scene must see one clock, or a shared wind field blows in two
   *   different directions — and it is why the argument is passed explicitly
   *   rather than left to default.
   * - It is still injected, never read: §33 is satisfied because the value comes
   *   from the context, not from a wall clock.
   *
   * Emission and death bookkeeping belong to the emitter (`emitter.ts` pins the
