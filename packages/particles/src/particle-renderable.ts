/**
 * `ParticleRenderable` (§36, §49, plan P9-3) — the scene node that puts a
 * {@link ParticleEmitter}'s pool on screen as **one batched draw**.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const particles = new ParticleRenderable(
 *   new ParticleEmitter({ maxParticles: 10000, emissionRate: 500, … }),
 * );
 * scene.add(particles);
 *
 * // per fixed step (§10):
 * particles.emitter.step(1 / 60, simulationTime);
 * // per rendered frame: buildRenderList picks the node up and emits one item.
 * ```
 *
 * ## What it is, and what it deliberately is not
 *
 * §49 lists `ParticleSystem` among the `Renderable` subclasses, and that is
 * where this class belongs. It **cannot extend `Renderable`**, and the reason is
 * a hard constraint rather than a preference: the frozen §3.1 dependency matrix
 * gives `@four/particles` exactly `core`, `math`, and `scene`. `Renderable`,
 * `RenderItem`, `BufferGeometry`, and every material live in packages this one
 * may not import — the matrix is a plan ground rule ("never add or reverse an
 * edge"), and `particles` and `render` sit in the *same* dispatch wave, so an
 * edge between them is not merely undeclared but ordering-illegal.
 *
 * So this class extends `@four/scene`'s `Node` and implements
 * `@four/render`'s **structural** `ParticleDrawable` contract — the brand, the
 * two sort keys, the count, the instance array, and the repack method. Read
 * `@four/render`'s `src/particles.ts` for the contract, the interleaved layout,
 * the blending policy, and the §43 statement; this file implements them and does
 * not restate the arguments.
 *
 * **Nothing type-checks the two declarations against each other** (neither
 * package can see the other). `tests/particle-renderable.test.ts` pins the shape
 * member by member, and `@four/render-webgl`'s suite pins the layout from the
 * other side. When a later revision lets particles depend on render, this class
 * re-parents onto `Renderable`, `implements ParticleDrawable` becomes literal,
 * and nothing else changes. (Decision, WP-9.3 — reported to the orchestrator.)
 *
 * ## Ownership
 *
 * The renderable **owns its instance array** — one `Float32Array` of
 * `capacity × PARTICLE_INSTANCE_FLOATS`, allocated in the constructor and
 * rewritten in place forever after. It does **not** own the emitter's pool, does
 * not step the simulation (the §39 loop does), and has no `dispose()`: there is
 * no GPU resource and no external subscription here, and the array dies with the
 * node.
 *
 * ## Allocation (§7b, plan D7)
 *
 * {@link ParticleRenderable.updateParticleInstances} and
 * {@link ParticleRenderable.computeBounds} allocate **nothing** — no typed
 * arrays, no math objects, no iterators. Both read the pool's channel arrays
 * directly rather than through `ParticlePool`'s accessors, which is the pattern
 * `pool.ts` documents for hot loops (the accessors validate every index; at
 * 100 000 particles that is 100 000 range checks per frame for an invariant the
 * loop bound already guarantees).
 *
 * ## The ramp evaluation is the pool's, to the bit
 *
 * Size and colour are stored as start/end pairs plus age (§36 "color and size
 * over lifetime"), and the drawn value is the ramp at the particle's normalized
 * age. This module evaluates it in exactly the form `ParticlePool.getSize` and
 * `ParticlePool.getColor` use — `start + (end − start) · t`, with `t` from the
 * same clamped `age / lifetime` and the same non-positive-lifetime rule — so
 * what is drawn is bit-identical to what the pool reports. The tests assert that
 * against the pool's own accessors rather than against a re-derivation.
