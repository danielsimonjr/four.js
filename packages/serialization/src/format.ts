/**
 * The §79 scene document — its types, its JSON encoding, and its canonical
 * validation (plan P11-1).
 *
 * §79 fixes the goals a scene file has to meet: *versioned; deterministic;
 * backend-independent; schema-validatable; diff-friendly; extensible; capable of
 * preserving unknown extension data*, with node ids that "serialize with the
 * scene" and components that "serialize under registered type names". This
 * module is that document written down as a type plus the three operations a
 * document needs: **validate** an arbitrary value into canonical form, **encode**
 * it to text, and **decode** text back into it. Producing one from a live scene
 * graph is `serializer.ts`'s job; upgrading an older one is `migration.ts`'s.
 *
 * ## What the document holds — and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * A node carries its identity, its name, its type name, its transform, its §42
 * transform authority, the §6 display flags (`visible`, `enabled`, `opacity`),
 * its tags, its free-form metadata, its components, and its children. That is
 * everything `Node` itself owns.
 *
 * It does not *interpret* subclass state — a camera's field of view, a mesh's
 * geometry reference, a widget's box model. `@four/serialization` may depend on
 * `core`, `math`, and `scene` only (plan §3.1), so it cannot even name those
 * types, and inventing a schema for them here would pin an API this packet may
 * not open. It does **carry** it, opaquely: {@link SceneNodeDocument.data} is
 * one JSON value per node, written by
 * {@link SerializeSceneOptions.nodeDataOf} and read back by the matching
 * {@link InstantiateSceneOptions.nodeFactory}, exactly as
 * {@link ComponentDocument.data} carries a component payload this package
 * cannot read either (2026-08-06 — the note that used to stand here said
 * subclass state "belongs in … a later revision of this format", and left every
 * non-trivial scene needing application-authored round-trip code; the umbrella
 * `four` package now ships `registerSceneNodeTypes()` over this seam).
 *
 * The field is optional and absent unless a writer produces one, so every
 * document written before it existed encodes byte for byte as it did.
 *
 * Physics state, animation state, and replay data are likewise absent — §79
 * requires exactly that ("separate optional sections so static scene definitions
 * remain clean"); the §34 replay document in `@four/diagnostics` is the sibling
 * format that carries simulation state.
 *
 * ## Canonical form
 *
 * {@link validateSceneDocument} does not merely check a document — it rebuilds
 * it, field by field, in a fixed key order, dropping every field it does not
 * know and every field that already holds its default. So one scene has exactly
 * one spelling, `encodeSceneDocument(decodeSceneDocument(text)) === text` for
 * every document this package produced, and
 * `serialize(instantiate(serialize(scene)))` is textually identical to
 * `serialize(scene)` — the round-trip gate of plan P11-1. Dropping unknown keys
 * is also what keeps a `__proto__` — or any other injected field — out of the
 * objects handed to the instantiator.
 *
 * ## Numbers
 *
 * Every number is finite: `NaN` and `±Infinity` are refused rather than written,
 * because `JSON.stringify` turns them into `null` and a scene that reloads with
 * a `null` position is a defect discovered far from its cause. `-0` is
 * normalized to `0`, matching `JSON.stringify` and the §33 checksum's treatment
 * of the two zeros. Angles are radians and times are seconds throughout (§7a);
 * this format contains neither, but the math types it stores are authored in
 * those units.
