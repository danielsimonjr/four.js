/**
 * `NodeMaterial` (§57, §60) — the material family member that carries a
 * shader graph (RFC 0001, accepted 2026-08-21; gap R-14).
 *
 * ## The family's sanctioned extension surface
 *
 * §57 listed both `ShaderMaterial` and `NodeMaterial`. Spec revision 1.11
 * records `ShaderMaterial` as **permanently unshipped** (RFC 0001 Q1, owner
 * decision): a source-string material would re-open §96 and §63's opacity for
 * one row, and this class is what closes it instead — its shading is a graph
 * of closed operators (`shader-graph.ts`), never text.
 *
 * ## Unlit at this tier, stated rather than softened
 *
 * A node material does not see §68's directional light or the scene ambient
 * term (RFC 0001 §6, the MVP's sharpest limitation): enough for §70 effects,
 * procedural colour, exact §58 gradients, UV animation and screen-space work
 * — not enough for R-13's PBR path. Lighting-aware graphs wait on a
 * light-uniform contract §68's tier does not have (sequencing R-14 → R-17 →
 * R-13).
 *
 * ## Uniform ownership is per material (RFC 0001 Q3, decided)
 *
 * A thousand materials may share one graph — the backend compiles **one**
 * program for them, keyed on the graph's structure — and each material owns
 * its own uniform values and texture bindings, uploaded per draw. Per-*node*
 * values would need a per-drawable uniform block and are deferred with it.
 *
 * ## §79
 *
 * By RFC 0001's compatibility decision, this packet serializes nothing:
 * materials are not serialized as classes today — a `Renderable`'s material is
 * a **reference** resolved through the `SceneResourceCatalog` seam, which a
 * `NodeMaterial` already satisfies with zero new code. When a material
 * document form lands, a `ShaderGraph` is already JSON by construction and
 * carries its own `domain`, which is what makes it a safe §96 payload.

 *
 * The graph is **immutable** — frozen at construction. Changing shading means
 * building a new graph and a new material; that is what makes a backend's
 * program cache a pure function of the graph (RFC 0001 §2). Uniform values
 * and textures are the mutable half, and — like the rest of §57's render
 * state — writing them does **not** bump {@link Material.version}: a backend
 * reads them per draw and caches nothing against them.
 *
 * Rendering it requires the backend's node pipeline to be registered
 * (`registerNodeMaterialPipeline()` on WebGL 2); an unregistered node
 * material is **skipped** with a one-time §85 warning, never drawn flat — a
 * graph the author wrote is a specific picture, and drawing an unrelated one
 * would be R-6's "a JSON value must not become a different picture" in the
