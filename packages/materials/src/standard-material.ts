/**
 * `StandardMaterial` (§59) — the metallic-roughness workflow, at the tier this
 * engine can honestly shade today.
 *
 * §59 is one sentence and one constructor:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const material = new Four.StandardMaterial({
 *     baseColor: "#a0a0a0",
 *     roughness: 0.6,
 *     metalness: 0.1,
 *     normalMap,
 *     occlusionMap,
 *     emissive: "#000000"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * — *"StandardMaterial shall implement a metallic-roughness workflow compatible
 * with glTF conventions"* — plus a list of later physical extensions
 * (clearcoat, transmission, IOR, sheen, anisotropy, subsurface, iridescence)
 * that §57 puts on `PhysicalMaterial` above this class.
 *
 * ## What ships, and what is staged with the reason (R-13, 2026-08-08)
 *
 * | §59 names            | here                                            |
 * | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
 * | `baseColor`          | {@link StandardMaterial.baseColor} (+ optional {@link StandardMaterial.map}) |
 * | `metalness`          | {@link StandardMaterial.metalness}              |
 * | `roughness`          | {@link StandardMaterial.roughness}              |
 * | `emissive`           | {@link StandardMaterial.emissive}               |
 * | `normalMap`          | **staged** — needs the tangent attribute        |
 * | `occlusionMap`       | **staged** — needs a second texture unit        |
 *
 * The two staged maps are staged for causes that are recorded elsewhere and are
 * not this packet's to fix:
 *
 * - **`normalMap` needs tangents.** A tangent-space normal map is meaningless
 *   without a per-vertex tangent frame, and §53's tangent attribute was
 *   deliberately left out by R-19 (2026-08-07) when `uvs` and `colors` landed —
 *   see `@four/geometry`'s `BufferGeometry`. Shipping the field without the
 *   attribute would put a texture in the public API that every geometry in the
 *   engine silently ignores.
 * - **`occlusionMap` — and glTF's `metallicRoughnessMap` and `emissiveMap` with
 *   it — need a second texture unit.** This backend tier binds exactly one
 *   texture per draw at `MAP_TEXTURE_UNIT`, and §77's multi-texture
 *   materials are what will bring the unit allocator (`@four/render-webgl`'s
 *   `gl-program.ts` says so, in those words, and has since WP-3a.3). A base
 *   colour map is the one texture that needs nothing new; the other four each
 *   need the same missing thing, so they arrive together with it.
 *
 * §59's seven physical extensions are `PhysicalMaterial`'s (§57's family puts it
 * above this class) and are not sketched here.
 *
 * ## The BRDF tier, stated (§59, §68)
 *
 * The shading model is real metallic-roughness — Cook-Torrance with a GGX
 * (Trowbridge-Reitz) normal distribution, a height-correlated Smith visibility
 * term, and a Schlick Fresnel over `F0 = mix(0.04, baseColor, metalness)` —
 * evaluated against the **one** directional light and the scene ambient term
 * §68's MVP tier collects (`@four/render`'s `lights.ts`). One light is not a
 * limitation of this material: multi-light needs §68's uniform arrays or its
 * clustered path, staged where `@four/scene`'s `light.ts` records it. A
 * Lambert-versus-GGX difference under one light is still the difference between
 * a plastic and a metal, which is what §59 is for.
 *
 * There is **no image-based lighting**, so a fully metallic surface has nothing
 * to reflect: metals carry no diffuse lobe, and with no environment the ambient
 * term contributes nothing to them. `metalness: 1` under ambient light alone
 * therefore renders black. That is the physically honest answer rather than a
 * bug, and §68's "environment lighting; image-based lighting" is what changes
 * it.
 *
 * ## Colour space (§60a) — the same linear working space `LitMaterial` uses
 *
 * **Superseded 2026-08-08 by R-15.** This block used to read "no colour space
 * attached … tagging a space here would pin half of R-15's design by accident",
 * and that deferral is now resolved rather than still open: §60a's working-space
 * policy is written down (`@four/math`'s `color.ts` module header), and it says
 * these numbers **are linear-light**. Nothing about the values changed — the
 * BRDF multiplied them as linear before the policy existed and multiplies them
 * as linear now — but the space is no longer *untagged*: it is named, and the
 * one thing it was waiting for, an encode on the way out, exists as
 * `@four/render`'s `OutputTransformEffect`.
 *
 * What is unchanged, and stays: no per-material colour-space field. §60a puts
 * its metadata on *resources* — textures (§77) and render targets (§63) — and a
 * material colour is a working-space value by definition, so a tag here would
 * have exactly one legal value. Values outside 0…1 still pass through rather
 * than clamp (the WP-3.3 decision `UnlitMaterial` records), which is how an HDR
 * emissive is authored; non-finite values are still rejected (§85).
 *
 * The match with `LitMaterial` is deliberate, not an oversight: the standard and
 * lit pipelines write straight (non-premultiplied) alpha into the same
 * framebuffer, so the two families **compose in one scene** — a
 * `StandardMaterial` sphere beside a `LitMaterial` floor is shaded in one space
 * and blended by one rule. R-15 moved both at once, as this block promised:
 * neither family encodes its own output, because §60a makes the transform the
 * *final render-graph pass*, not a per-material step.
 *
 * Tone mapping (§68) is still staged — it is the other half of §60a's output
 * transform and needs the HDR float targets R-4 staged; `@four/render`'s
 * `effect-pass.ts` carries the reason.
 *
 * ## Putting one on a node (§49)
 *
 * `new Renderable(geometry, new StandardMaterial())` infers
 * `Renderable<StandardMaterial>` and needs nothing said. A variable *annotated*
 * as a bare `Renderable` is a different thing: that type parameter defaults to
 * `@four/render`'s `SurfaceMaterial`, deliberately still `UnlitMaterial |
 * LitMaterial`, and §59's member is not in it. Widening that union would take
 * `color` and `setColor` off every ordinary renderable's material — the exact
 * argument `renderable.ts` records for keeping `SpriteMaterial` out of it, and
 * it applies unchanged to a base colour. Name the parameter
 * (`Renderable<StandardMaterial>`, or `Renderable<Material>` for a node whose
 * material is swapped between families) and nothing else changes: the render
 * list picks the pipeline off the material's own `kind`, never off the node's
 * type (R-13, 2026-08-08).
 *
 * ## CSS colour strings (§59's own example, R-15, 2026-08-08)
 *
 * `baseColor: "#a0a0a0"` still does not compile against this class — but the
 * parser it needs now exists, and the reason the option is not widened is a
 * spec citation rather than an absence:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const baseColor: ColorRGBA = [0, 0, 0, 1];
 * srgbToLinearRGBA(parseColor("#a0a0a0"), baseColor);   // @four/math
 * new StandardMaterial({ baseColor });                  // §59's example, today
 * ```
 *
 * §60a says a CSS string denotes an **sRGB** value and the pipeline is
 * linear-light, so a string can never be assigned to a working-space slot
 * without the decode above. §101's shipped-name mapping then settles where the
 * decode lives: "Colors are linear RGBA arrays in 0..1 (§60a), **not CSS
 * strings**". Widening these options to `ColorRGBA | string` contradicts that
 * row, so R-15 left it to the owner and shipped the two functions that make the
 * conversion one line (recorded 2026-08-08).

 * alone, and a geometry without a `normals` attribute has no surface to shade
 * against and falls back to that same ambient term (see
 * `@four/render-webgl`'s standard fragment stage).
 *
 * `StandardMaterial` sits **above** `LitMaterial` in §57's family, not
 * beside it: the lit tier is one Lambert lobe times a colour, this one is a
 * diffuse and a specular lobe with a Fresnel between them. The two shade in the
 * same space and blend by the same rule (see the module header), so mixing them
 * in one scene is supported and cheap — the cost of a second surface family is
 * one pipeline switch where the render list changes `kind`.
