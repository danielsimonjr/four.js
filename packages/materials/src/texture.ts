/**
 * The read surface of a texture as a **material** and a rendering backend see
 * it (§77) — implemented by `@four/render`'s `Texture`.
 *
 * ## Why the contract is declared here (decision, WP-3a.3, widened by R-19)
 *
 * The concrete `Texture` class lives in `@four/render`, because a texture is a
 * renderer resource (§61, §77) and `@four/render` is where the renderer
 * interface lives. But the dependency matrix (plan §3.1, frozen) puts
 * `materials` *below* `render` — `render` depends on `materials`, never the
 * other way round — so this package cannot import that class.
 *
 * So the **contract** is declared here and `@four/render`'s `Texture` declares
 * `implements SpriteTexture`: the compiler checks the two agree, the dependency
 * edge stays pointing the one legal way, and a caller writes
 * `new SpriteMaterial({ texture })` or `new UnlitMaterial({ map })` with a real
 * `Texture` and never sees the seam. It is the same technique
 * `@four/render-webgl` uses for the GL context it does not own, one layer down.
 *
 * It lives in a module of its own since R-19 (2026-08-07), when
 * `UnlitMaterial.map` and `LitMaterial.map` made it the *family's* texture
 * contract rather than the sprite's: it was declared in `sprite-material.ts`
 * while sprites were the only textured pipeline, and `SpriteTexture` remains
 * exported from there, as an alias, because it is a published name.
 *
 * {@link MaterialTexture} describes the texture's whole **read** surface, not
 * only the parts a material touches: a backend reaches the texture *through*
 * the material (`item.material.map`), so anything the upload path needs — the
 * texel data above all — has to be visible here.
 *
 * ## Ownership (§83)
 *
 * A material **points at** its texture; it does not own it. One texture atlas
 * routinely backs hundreds of materials, so `Material.dispose()` deliberately
 * does *not* dispose the texture: whoever created the texture disposes it.
 * Tearing it out from under its other users is exactly the bug the ownership
 * rule exists to prevent. This is the same rule `Renderable` follows for its
 * geometry and material.

 *
 * A mip-choosing value is only meaningful on a texture that *has* a mip chain:
 * GL leaves a texture with one level and a `*_MIPMAP_*` min filter **incomplete**
 * — it samples as opaque black — which is why `@four/render`'s `Texture` refuses
 * the combination (§85) rather than letting a scene go silently black.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no** `magFilter`: magnification cannot use mip levels
 * (GL accepts only `NEAREST`/`LINEAR` there), so the pair `minFilter` and
 * `magFilter` would be a split in which one half could never carry the four
 * values that motivated the split. {@link MaterialTexture.filter} *is* the
 * magnification filter, and the default for minification too.
