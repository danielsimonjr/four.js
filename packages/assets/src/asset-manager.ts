/**
 * The asset manager (§76) — one cache, one refcount, one fetch per asset.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const assets = new AssetManager();                 // uses globalThis.fetch
 * const level = await assets.load("/levels/1.json", jsonLoader);
 * // …later, when the level is gone:
 * assets.release("/levels/1.json", jsonLoader);
 * ```
 *
 * §76 asks the asset manager for deduplication, caching, reference counting,
 * lazy loading, streaming, dependency graphs, progress reporting, cancellation,
 * retries, worker decoding, hot reload, and content hashing. This module ships
 * all of them. Streaming, graphs, progress, worker decoding, and hot reload
 * are injected seams (2026-09-06, A-18 remainder): none invents a transport,
 * a websocket protocol, or a real `Worker` — each is present when the host
 * passes the matching factory, and degrades without it. The MVP reading is
 * the plan's (P11-2): an asset manager whose caching and lifetime rules are
 * exactly specified and fully tested beats a wider surface whose corners are
 * guesses.
 *
 * ## Everything is injected, including IO
 *
 * The manager never names a browser or Node API. It takes a {@link FetchLike} —
 * a function from a URL to something with `ok`, `status`, `arrayBuffer()`,
 * `text()`, and `json()` — which the platform's `fetch` satisfies structurally,
 * and which a unit test satisfies with a plain object. Loaders are the same:
 * they are values the caller passes in, not a registry the manager owns.
 *
 * **On defaulting to `globalThis.fetch` (WP-11.2 decision, 2026-08-02).** §1
 * rule 5 bans wall clocks and `Math.random` from *simulation* code because they
 * destroy determinism. An asset manager is IO, not simulation: it runs before
 * and between frames, its results are content-addressed by URL, and no fixed
 * step depends on it. So the default is allowed here and only here — a
 * constructor with no options resolves `globalThis.fetch` once (bound to
 * `globalThis`, because an extracted `fetch` is an illegal invocation in some
 * browsers). If the runtime has no global `fetch`, construction still succeeds
 * and the first {@link AssetManager.load} throws
 * `INVALID_APPLICATION_STATE` naming the missing dependency, rather than
 * failing at import time in an environment that was only ever going to inject
 * its own.
 *
 * ## Cache identity: `url` **and** loader object identity
 *
 * A cache slot is the pair (`url`, `loader`), where the loader is compared by
 * **object identity** (`===`), not by `loader.name`:
 *
 * - `load("/a.json", jsonLoader)` twice → one fetch, one cached value, refcount
 *   2. `jsonLoader` is a module-level singleton, so this is the common case.
 * - `load("/a.bin", binaryLoader)` and `load("/a.bin", textLoader)` → two
 *   fetches and two independent entries. The same bytes decoded two ways are
 *   two assets with two lifetimes; collapsing them would make `release` ambiguous
 *   and `get` unsound (the two `T`s differ).
 * - `createImageLoader(decodeA)` and `createImageLoader(decodeB)` → two
 *   distinct loader objects, therefore two distinct entries, even though both
 *   are called `"image"`. Factory-built loaders should be hoisted to a constant
 *   by the application if it wants them to share a cache slot.
 *
 * Names are used only for diagnostics (error `context.loader`).
 *
 * ## Coalescing, and what a refcount counts
 *
 * A refcount counts **calls to `load` that were handed the asset**, not
 * consumers that happen to hold it. `load` increments synchronously, before it
 * awaits anything, so two concurrent `load`s of the same key produce one fetch
 * (the second joins the in-flight promise) and a refcount of 2. `get` and `has`
 * are peeks: they never change the count. Every `load` therefore pairs with
 * exactly one {@link AssetManager.release}.
 *
 * On the last release the entry is evicted and, if the asset implements
 * `Disposable` (§83), disposed. Releasing an asset whose load is still in flight
 * is legal: the entry stays until the fetch settles, and is evicted and disposed
 * the moment it does, so a released asset never lingers in the cache.
 *
 * ## Cancellation (§76, 2026-08-09)
 *
 * A caller that may stop wanting an asset passes a signal:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const controller = new AbortController();
 * const level = assets.load("/levels/1.json", jsonLoader, {
 *   signal: controller.signal,
 * });
 * controller.abort();   // `level` rejects; the reference it took is given back
 * ```
 *
 * Three rules, and they are the whole contract:
 *
 * 1. **An aborted load never holds a reference.** A signal that is already
 *    aborted refuses before the cache is even consulted — no entry, no fetch, no
 *    increment. A signal that aborts later hands back the one reference its
 *    `load` took. Either way the caller must **not** call {@link
 *    AssetManager.release} for it, exactly as it would not for a load that
 *    failed.
 * 2. **One waiter's abort is not the others'.** Aborting decrements; the fetch
 *    is abandoned only when the count reaches zero, i.e. when the *last* waiter
 *    on a coalesced load has gone. A second caller awaiting the same key still
 *    gets its asset. This is the only answer consistent with the refcount above:
 *    a coalesced load is shared, so no single sharer may cancel it.
 * 3. **`release` is not `abort`.** Releasing the last reference to a pending load
 *    still lets it settle (rule unchanged since WP-11.2). `release` says "I no
 *    longer need the asset"; it is not permission to reject a promise the caller
 *    is still holding — doing so would turn an orderly teardown into an
 *    unhandled rejection in application code. Cancellation has its own channel
 *    because it is the caller *asking* for that rejection.
 *
 * When the last waiter aborts, the entry is evicted immediately (so the key is
 * retryable at once and no later `load` coalesces onto a load nobody wants), and
 * the transport is aborted **if the manager was given the capability** —
 * {@link AssetManagerOptions.abortController}, reported by
 * {@link AssetManager.canAbortTransport}. Without it the promise semantics are
 * identical and the socket merely drains, exactly as with the §96 deadline. The
 * deadline uses the same handle: a timed-out load now aborts its request instead
 * of leaving it running.
 *
 * The signal itself is structural ({@link AbortSignalLike}) — the DOM's
 * `AbortSignal` satisfies it, and so does `{ aborted: false, addEventListener,
 * removeEventListener }` in a test.
 *
 * ## Untrusted content (§96)
 *
 * §96 opens *"asset loaders and scene deserializers shall treat external
 * content as untrusted"* and names **input-size limits** and **cancellation and
 * timeouts for expensive decoders** among its requirements. Both are enforced
 * here, because this is the only place in the engine that touches a network:
 *
 * - **{@link AssetManagerOptions.maximumBytes}** (default
 *   {@link DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_BYTES}) is checked twice. First against the
 *   response's declared `content-length`, *before* the body is read at all — a
 *   4 GB download is refused while it is still a header. Then against what the
 *   body actually produced, because a `content-length` is a claim by the same
 *   party that sent the bytes: the loader is handed a bounded view of the
 *   response whose `arrayBuffer()`, `text()`, and `json()` refuse an
 *   over-budget body instead of returning it.
 * - **{@link AssetManagerOptions.timeoutSeconds}** (default
 *   {@link DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS}) bounds the *whole* load — transport and
 *   decode together, since §96's phrase is "expensive decoders" and a decoder
 *   that never returns is exactly as fatal as a socket that never closes.
 *
 * Both defaults are **finite**. A limit that defaults to `Infinity` is
 * documentation rather than a limit; either may be set to
 * `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` explicitly, which is how an application records
 * the decision to trust its origin.
 *
 * A refused load rejects with `ASSET_LOAD_FAILED` carrying
 * `context.limitName` (`"maximumBytes"` or `"timeoutSeconds"`), `context.limit`,
 * and — where there is one — `context.observed`. Like every other failure it is
 * not cached, so retrying is calling {@link AssetManager.load} again. An aborted
 * load rejects with the same code and `context.reason = "aborted"`: §89's list
 * has no cancellation code, and inventing one in `@four/core` to say what a
 * discriminating `context` already says would widen the engine's error
 * vocabulary for one caller.
 *
 * ## Failures are never cached
 *
 * A rejected load — transport failure, non-2xx status, or a loader that could
 * not decode the bytes — removes its entry before the rejection reaches the
 * caller. Retrying is therefore just calling `load` again (§76 "retries"), and
 * every waiter on the coalesced promise sees the same error. Failures are
 * reported as {@link FourError} with code `ASSET_LOAD_FAILED` (§89's existing
 * code — the only asset code in the union, and the exact fit), carrying
 * `context = { url, loader, status? }` and the underlying error as `cause`. An
 * error that is *already* a `FourError` is rethrown untouched: a loader that
 * diagnosed its own failure precisely should not have that diagnosis buried
 * under a generic wrapper.
 *
 * ## How the signal crosses the IO seam (measured, 2026-08-07 and 2026-08-09)
 *
 * A signal cannot simply be added to {@link FetchLike} as a concrete structural
 * type: widening it to `(url: string, init?: { signal?: AbortSignalLike }) => …`
 * makes the platform `fetch` **stop** satisfying it, because parameters are
 * contravariant and the DOM's `RequestInit.signal` is `AbortSignal | null` — a
 * structural `AbortSignalLike` "is missing the following properties from type
 * 'AbortSignal': onabort, reason, throwIfAborted, dispatchEvent", and the
 * missing ones cannot be declared without naming DOM types this package
 * refuses to name. `{ fetch }` would then need an adapter, and this module's
 * documented "no adapter needed" property would be gone.
 *
 * The shape that works — recorded here on 2026-08-07 as a design, built on
 * 2026-08-09 — is a *generic* seam: `FetchLike<TSignal = never>` paired with an
 * injected `() => { signal: TSignal; abort(): void }`. `TSignal` is inferred
 * from the browser's own `AbortController`, so `{ fetch, abortController: () =>
 * new AbortController() }` type-checks with no adapter and no DOM type named
 * here, while `{ fetch }` alone still infers `never` and every pre-existing call
 * site keeps compiling.
 *
 * One further measurement decided the *storage*, and it is not obvious: keeping
 * `TSignal` in a field (`#fetch: FetchLike<TSignal>`) makes `AssetManager` vary
 * with it, and `AssetManager<AbortSignal>` is then **not** assignable to
 * `AssetManager` — which would break `new Application({ assets })` for exactly
 * the managers that gained the capability. So the seam is erased at the
 * constructor: `TSignal` appears only in {@link AssetManagerOptions}, where it
 * does its one job of forcing `fetch` and `abortController` to agree, and the
 * fields hold a signal-agnostic closure. Every instantiation of the class is
 * therefore mutually assignable, as it was before.
 *
 * ## Content hashing and verification (§76, §79 — 2026-08-21)
 *
 * ```ts
 * // Record the hash of what was fetched…
 * await assets.load("/models/robot.bin", binaryLoader, { hashContent: true });
 * assets.contentHash("/models/robot.bin", binaryLoader); // "sha256-9f86d0…"
 *
 * // …or declare it up front, which is §79's manifest reloading its asset.
 * await assets.load("/models/robot.bin", binaryLoader, {
 *   expectedHash: manifest.robot.hash,
 * });   // rejects if the bytes are not the bytes the manifest named
 * ```
 *
 * Four rules:
 *
 * 1. **The hash covers the response's bytes**, whatever the loader reads. A
 *    hashed load therefore reads the body once as bytes and derives `text()` and
 *    `json()` from them (through {@link AssetManagerOptions.decodeText}), so the
 *    same URL hashes identically under `binaryLoader` and `jsonLoader`. A hash
 *    that depended on which loader observed it could not be written in a
 *    manifest at all.
 * 2. **Verification is per caller, not per load.** A coalesced load computes one
 *    hash; each waiter compares it against *its own* `expectedHash`. One
 *    caller's wrong expectation rejects that caller and hands back its
 *    reference (`context.reason === "hash-mismatch"`) — exactly as an abort
 *    does, and for the same reason: the other waiters asked for something else.
 * 3. **A hash that could not be computed is a refusal, never a pass.** Asking
 *    for a hash on a manager with no {@link AssetManagerOptions.digest} throws
 *    `INVALID_APPLICATION_STATE` at the call, naming the injection point;
 *    joining a load that was *not* hashing rejects with
 *    `context.reason === "hash-unavailable"`. Silently skipping the check is the
 *    one behaviour §96 rules out — the check exists to be trusted.
 * 4. **Hashing is opt-in.** It forces the whole body through memory and costs a
 *    digest, so a load that did not ask for it fetches exactly as before.
 *
 * See `content-hash.ts` for why the default algorithm is SHA-256 rather than
 * something synchronous and cheap.
 *
 * ## Progress, streaming, graphs, workers, hot reload (§76, 2026-09-06)
 *
 * Five seams, each optional, each tested with an injected fake:
 *
 * 1. **Progress.** `load(url, loader, { onProgress })` receives
 *    `{ loaded, total, url }`. `total` is the declared `content-length` (or
 *    {@link FetchResponse.contentLength}) when the transport exposes one,
 *    otherwise `null`. Incremental events fire when `body.getReader` exists;
 *    a one-shot body still reports once the loader reads it. One waiter's
 *    callback is not the others' — the same rule as abort.
 * 2. **Streaming.** {@link AssetManager.stream} yields `Uint8Array` chunks
 *    from `body.getReader` when present, or the whole buffer once. A loader
 *    may also declare {@link AssetLoader.loadStream} and `load` will pass
 *    that iterable instead of a `FetchResponse` (not when hashing or worker
 *    decoding already consumed the body).
 * 3. **Dependency graphs.** {@link AssetManager.registerDependency} records
 *    a parent→child edge; {@link AssetManager.loadWithDependencies} loads
 *    registered children first. {@link AssetManager.loadGraph} walks those
 *    edges plus a loader result that carries `{ dependencies: string[] }`.
 *    Cycles refuse with `context.reason === "dependency-cycle"`.
 * 4. **Worker decoding.** `load(..., { decodeInWorker: true })` posts the
 *    response bytes to `{ workerFactory }` when one was injected
 *    ({@link WorkerLike}); without a factory the loader decodes in-process,
 *    as before. Tests inject a fake — no real `Worker` is required.
 * 5. **Hot reload.** {@link AssetManager.watch} exists always and forwards
 *    to `{ watch: (url, cb) => unsub }` when injected (a dev-server file
 *    watcher). Without it, `watch` throws `INVALID_APPLICATION_STATE`
 *    naming the injection point. There is no built-in websocket protocol.
 *
 * ## Staged (dated notes, 2026-08-02, WP-11.2)
 *
 * - **The §76 record form** `assets.load({ robot: "/models/robot.glb", … })`.
 *   It infers a loader per file extension, which presumes the glTF and texture
 *   loaders that §55/§77 gate (see `loaders.ts`). A version that could only
 *   infer JSON and text would be a worse API than passing the loader.
