/**
 * The §79 asset manifest — logical key → URL + content hash.
 *
 * §79's identity clause is exact: *"assets are referenced by logical key,
 * resolved through a manifest that maps each key to a URL and content hash
 * (§76)"*. This module is that map and the one operation it exists for —
 * resolving a key into a verified load:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const manifest = await assets.load("/assets.json", manifestLoader);
 * const robot = await loadFromManifest(assets, manifest, "robot", binaryLoader);
 * // …fetches manifest.robot.url and refuses bytes whose hash is not
 * // manifest.robot.hash (§96).
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why it lives here and not in `@four/four`
 *
 * A manifest is an *asset-manager* concept: it resolves keys to URLs and hands
 * the hash to the verification path in `asset-manager.ts`. What `@four/four`'s
 * scene serializers need (A-16) is the other end — a `SceneResourceCatalog`
 * whose `get(key)` answers a **already-loaded** `BufferGeometry` or `Material`,
 * synchronously, because deserialization is synchronous. So the wiring is
 * necessarily two steps: preload every key a document names through the
 * manifest, then hand the resulting map to `resourceCatalog(...)`. Step one is
 * this module; step two is `preloadManifestIntoCatalog` on the umbrella,
 * because that is the half that knows what a geometry or a material *is* and
 * because `get(key)` must stay synchronous. Naming the seam is the point of
 * this paragraph: nothing about §79's manifest is blocked on hashing any more.
 *
 * ## A manifest is untrusted content (§96)
 *
 * It arrives over the same network as everything else, so {@link
 * parseAssetManifest} validates its shape and refuses anything else, rather than
 * casting a parsed `unknown` and discovering the problem as a `TypeError` three
 * frames later. Note what it deliberately does **not** do: it does not check
 * that the URLs are same-origin, absolute, or otherwise safe. That is the
 * application's policy — it is the party that knows its own origins — and a
 * library that guessed would either block legitimate CDNs or imply a guarantee
 * it cannot keep.
