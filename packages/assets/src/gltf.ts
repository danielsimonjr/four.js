/**
 * The §78 glTF 2.0 loader — the **parse tier** (A-19's last half, 2026-08-29).
 *
 * ```ts
 * const gltfLoader = createGltfLoader({
 *   fetch,                          // the manager's own transport, for .bin
 *   decodeTexture: decodePng,       // the createTextureLoader seam, reused
 * });
 * const asset = await assets.load("/models/robot.glb", gltfLoader);
 * // …assembly into live nodes is `four`'s `instantiateGltf(asset)` (§3.1).
 * ```
 *
 * ## The tier, stated against §78's full promise
 *
 * §78 asks for geometry, materials, textures, skins, morph targets,
 * animations, cameras, lights extensions, compression extensions, and user
 * metadata. This module ships **glTF 2.0 core** at the tier the engine can
 * honestly carry today:
 *
 * - **Containers**: `.gltf` JSON and the GLB binary container; buffers from
 *   the GLB `BIN` chunk, base64 `data:` URIs, and external URIs through an
 *   injected {@link FetchLike} (presence is the capability — no transport, no
 *   external buffer, refused loudly).
 * - **Geometry**: every attribute the engine's geometry layer has — positions,
 *   normals, uvs, colors, joints, weights — plus indices, `triangles` and
 *   `lines` modes, interleaved and strided accessors.
 * - **Materials**: §59's metallic-roughness tier — base colour factor and
 *   texture, metallic/roughness factors, packed `metallicRoughnessTexture`
 *   (linear), emissive factor, `OPAQUE`/`BLEND`. Texture slots this tier
 *   still cannot sample (`normalTexture`, `occlusionTexture`,
 *   `emissiveTexture`) are validated, **not decoded**, and recorded per
 *   material as {@link GltfMaterialRecord.ignoredTextures}. WebGL samples
 *   the packed map; WebGPU still shades from the scalar factors.
 * - **Textures**: decoded through {@link createTextureLoader}'s injected
 *   seam with its §96 decompression bounds, tagged `srgb` for colour maps
 *   and `linear` for the packed metallic-roughness map, rows flipped to
 *   §7a's bottom-first order; uvs are converted (`v → 1 − v`) in the same
 *   pass, so a loaded model samples exactly what its author painted.
 * - **Skins**: joints, inverse bind matrices (glTF's +Y-bone authoring
 *   convention is absorbed by the inverse binds — RFC 0003 — so no axis
 *   conversion happens anywhere). The §62 48-joint ceiling is **not**
 *   re-declared here: `Mesh.skeleton`'s landed refusal fires at instantiation,
 *   where the constant lives.
 * - **Animations**: `translation`/`rotation`/`scale` channels with `LINEAR`
 *   and `STEP` samplers, parsed into per-channel keyframe arrays that
 *   `instantiateGltf` binds through RFC 0003's indexed-array forms
 *   (`nodes.<i>.transform.<channel>`).
 * - **User metadata**: `extras` on the document, nodes, meshes, and materials,
 *   detached via `cloneJsonValue`.
 *
 * **Refused, loudly and by name** (§85, §96 — retrying cannot fix a file):
 * any `extensionsRequired` entry (Draco and every other compression extension
 * arrives as one), sparse accessors, morph targets (`primitive.targets`,
 * `mesh.weights`, `node.weights`, `weights` animation channels — the GPU
 * morph path is staged, and loading weights that deform nothing would draw
 * the wrong picture), `CUBICSPLINE` samplers, `MASK` alpha (no cutoff in the
 * material tier), point/strip/fan primitive modes, `TEXCOORD_1`-indexed
 * texture slots, accessors without a buffer view, and non-base64 `data:`
 * URIs.
 *
 * **Ignored with a record** (content whose absence cannot corrupt the
 * picture; each is pushed into {@link GltfAsset.ignored} and §85-warned
 * once): cameras, `extensionsUsed`-only extensions, unrecognized vertex
 * attributes (`TANGENT`, `TEXCOOORD_1`, second sets), mip-selecting
 * `minFilter` values, and a `wrapT` differing from `wrapS` (the texture tier
 * carries one wrap mode).
 *
 * ## §96: a glTF file is exactly the untrusted input this section exists for
 *
 * Every byte offset is checked against the container it indexes before it is
 * read: GLB chunks against the declared and actual lengths, buffer views
 * against buffers, accessors against buffer views (stride included), indices
 * against vertex counts, joints against their skin's joint list, and every
 * cross-reference (node children, meshes, skins, materials, textures, images,
 * samplers, scenes, animation targets) against its array. Subresources —
 * external buffers, embedded base64, decoded images — are bounded by
 * {@link GltfLoaderOptions.maximumBytes} and the texture tier's §96
 * decompression bounds **before** allocation wherever a size is declared.
 * Every float that can reach a transform — node TRS and matrices, inverse
 * bind matrices, animation times and values, and every decoded vertex
 * attribute — is validated finite (§85: no NaN, no Infinity). The JSON body
 * goes through `parseUntrustedJson`'s depth and length guards before any
 * recursive consumer sees it.
 *
 * ## Determinism (§33)
 *
 * Parsing is a pure function of the input bytes: every walk follows the
 * file's own arrays by index, object-key scans follow JSON insertion order
 * (the document's own order), accessor reads are explicit little-endian
 * `DataView` arithmetic, and nothing consults a clock, a `Map` iteration, or
 * the platform's endianness. Same bytes, same asset — byte-identical typed
 * arrays included.
 *
 * ## Why this package cannot assemble a scene (§3.1)
 *
 * `@four/assets` depends on `core` alone (the frozen matrix), so a `Mesh`, a
 * `Skeleton`, a `StandardMaterial`, and an `AnimationClip` are all names it
 * must not know. The parse tier therefore produces **plain validated data**
 * — typed arrays and records — and the umbrella package, which sees
 * everything, owns `instantiateGltf` (the `TextureAsset`/`TextureSource`
 * precedent, one level up: data below the seam, assembly above it).
