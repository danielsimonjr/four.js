   * ```text
   * zAxis = normalize(−direction)      // local +Z, opposite the aim

   *
   * A zero-length `direction`, a zero-length `up`, an `up` parallel to
   * `direction`, or a non-finite component of either leaves every component
   * alone and does **not** fire the change hook: there is no rotation those
   * inputs describe, and the two rejected alternatives are both worse.
   * Resetting to the identity substitutes a different, plausible-looking
   * orientation for the failure (the reasoning `Matrix4.invert` already gives
   * for refusing a singular matrix); picking a fallback `up` silently rewrites
   * the aim the caller asked for. Leaving the previous aim in place is the only
   * outcome that neither invents nor destroys information.
