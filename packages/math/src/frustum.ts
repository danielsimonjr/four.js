/**
 * The six clip planes of a view-projection matrix (§87) — the primitive a
 * frustum cull tests against.
 *
 * ```ts
 * viewProjection.copy(camera.projectionMatrix).multiply(camera.viewMatrix);
 * frustum.setFromViewProjection(viewProjection);
 * if (frustum.intersectsSphere(center, radius)) draw(item);
 * ```
 *
 * §87 lists the spatial *structures* a culler may sit on — AABB tree, quadtree,
 * octree, BVH, grid, the physics broad phase — and is silent about the test at
 * the bottom of all of them, which is this: a bounding volume against the six
 * half-spaces that bound what a camera can see. This class is that test and
 * nothing else. It builds no index, holds no scene, and caches nothing, so it
 * is equally the leaf of a future BVH walk and the whole of the linear scan
 * `@four/render`'s per-view list does today.
 *
 * ## Why a sphere is the only volume it accepts
 *
 * A sphere is invariant under rotation, so a world-space bounding sphere is one
 * point transform and one scalar — where a world-space AABB has to be
 * *re-derived* from the local box every time the node turns. That makes the
 * per-item cost of culling a constant that does not depend on the item's
 * orientation, which is what lets the cull run over every item of every view
 * every frame. The price is that a sphere around a long thin box is loose, so
 * this test keeps some items a box test would have rejected. It never rejects
 * one a box test would have kept: **a false keep costs a draw, a false reject
 * costs a missing object**, and only one of those is a bug.
 *
 * `@four/render`'s `computeWorldBoundingSphere` is the producer; it derives the
 * sphere from §53's cached local AABB.
 *
 * ## Storage
 *
 * Six planes in one `Float64Array(24)`, four numbers each — `(nx, ny, nz, d)`,
 * the plane `n · p + d = 0` with `n` a **unit** normal pointing *into* the
 * frustum, so `n · p + d` is a signed distance in world units and can be
 * compared against a radius directly. The order is left, right, bottom, top,
 * near, far; nothing outside this class depends on it, and the flat array is
 * what keeps a build allocation-free (§7b, plan D7).
 *
 * ## Determinism (§33)
 *
 * **`same-runtime`**, and no better: normalizing a plane needs `Math.sqrt`,
 * whose result is exactly specified by IEEE-754 but which sits in the same
 * `Math` family §33's `same-platform` tier tells simulation paths to avoid.
 * That is not a problem here and is worth stating precisely rather than
 * quietly: nothing this class computes reaches a solver, a checksum, or a
 * snapshot. A cull decision changes *which draws are submitted*, never a
 * number the simulation carries forward, so a replay recorded on one engine
 * reproduces bit-exactly on another even if the two disagree about whether one
 * marginal item was drawn.
 *
 * ## Validation (§85, §61)
 *
 * Nothing here throws — `@four/math` validates nothing (the rule
 * `Matrix4.setPerspective` states), and this class is read inside a frame,
 * where §61 forbids throwing outright. Instead **every degenerate input fails
 * towards drawing**: a plane whose normal has no length (a singular or
 * non-projection matrix) is written as the everything-inside plane, and a
 * `NaN` centre or radius makes {@link Frustum.intersectsSphere} answer `true`.
 * A frustum nobody configured therefore culls nothing, which is the only safe
 * direction for a filter that removes draws.

   * Extracts the six planes from `viewProjection` (`projection · view`) and

   * own bounds on `z`, and each of those inequalities is a row of the matrix
   * added to or subtracted from the `w` row. The planes are then normalized, so

   * @param viewProjection the camera's projection times its view matrix. It is
   * read, never written, and never retained.
   * @param depthRange the clip-space depth convention `viewProjection` was

   * `"negative-one-to-one"`, matching `Matrix4.setPerspective` and the WebGL 2
   * backend (§120); a WebGPU backend passes `"zero-to-one"` exactly as it does
